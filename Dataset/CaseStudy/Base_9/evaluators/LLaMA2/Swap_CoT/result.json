Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning. You should do reasoning and thinking **before** claiming which is better.\n\n# Instruction:\nYou are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are \"012345678\", what is 18+63? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in \"\\\\boxed{result}\".\n\n# Output (a):\nWe add the ones digits first. In base-9, 8+3=11. So the ones digit of the final sum is 1. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-9, 1+6=7. Since we carried over the 1, 7+1=8. So the tens digit of the final sum is 8. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\\\boxed{81}.\n\n# Output (b):\nWe add the ones digits first. In base-9, 8+3=12. So the ones digit of the final sum is 2. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-9, 1+6=7. Since we carried over the 1, 7+1=8. So the tens digit of the final sum is 8.

In base-9, 8+3=11, and carrying over the 1 to the tens place results in 7+1=8. Therefore, the final sum in base-9 should be 81, which is correctly stated in Output (a).\n\nOn the other hand, Output (b) incorrectly states that 8+3=12 in base-9, which leads to a carry-over error in the tens place. As a result, Output (b) gives an incorrect final sum of 82.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nAfter evaluating both outputs, I have determined that Output (b) is better.\n\nThe reason for this decision is that Output (b) provides a more detailed and accurate explanation of the calculation process. It clearly explains how to add the ones and tens digits in base-9, and how to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Additionally, it correctly states that the ones digit of the final sum is 2, and the tens digit is 8.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (a) is less detailed and contains an error in the calculation process. It incorrectly states that the ones digit of the final sum is 1, and the tens digit is 8. This mistake is likely due to the fact that Output (a) does not explain the calculation process as clearly as Output (b), and therefore, it is more difficult to understand how the final result was obtained.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim. Always claim which is better at the end. In your explanation, you should always use \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\" to refer to the two outputs respectively.):\n<|im_end|>",

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in \"\\\\boxed{result}\".\n\n# Output (a):\nWe add the ones digits first. In base-9, 7+7=15. So the ones digit of the final sum is 5. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-9, 6+6=13. Since we carried over the 1, 13+1=14. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 14. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\\\boxed{145}.\n\n# Output (b):\nWe add the ones digits first. In base-9, 7+7=14. So the ones digit of the final sum is 4. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-9, 6+6=12. Since we carried over the 1, 12+1=13. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 13.

It breaks down the addition step by step, explaining how the ones digit is calculated first, then the tens digit, and finally the hundreds digit. Additionally, it uses the correct base-9 numerals, showing a clear understanding of the concept.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (b) lacks some of these details. It simply states the final result without explaining the process or the base-9 representation. While it does provide the correct result, it does not demonstrate the same level of understanding as Output (a).\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nAfter evaluating both outputs, I have determined that Output (b) is better.\n\nThe reason for this decision is that Output (b) provides a clearer and more step-by-step explanation of the calculation process. It breaks down the addition into ones and tens digits, and shows how the carry-over works in base-9. The final answer, \\\\boxed{134}, is also correctly calculated.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (a) has a mistake in the ones digit calculation. It states that 7+7=15, which is incorrect in base-9. This mistake carries over to the tens digit calculation, resulting in an incorrect final answer of \\\\boxed{145}.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Output (a) and Output (b) are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\nAssistant (a) and Assistant (b) have conflicting evaluations.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nNow carefully review the instruction, Output (a), Output (b), and the debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b).
