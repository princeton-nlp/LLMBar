So, we write down 1 (10-9) and carry over 1 to the tens place.\n\nStep 2: Add the tens place: 5 (from 57) + 5 (from 53) + 1 (carried over) = 11. But again, 11 is not a valid single digit in base-9. So, we write down 2 (11-9) and carry over 1 to the next place.\n\nStep 3: Since there are no more digits to add, the carried over 1 becomes the leftmost digit.\n\nSo, 57 + 53 in base-9 is 121.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{121}.",
