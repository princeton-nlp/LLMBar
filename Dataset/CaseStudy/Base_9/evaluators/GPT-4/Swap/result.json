Then we add the tens digits. In base-9, 7+7=14. Since we carried over the 1, 14+1=15. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 15. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\\\boxed{145}.\n\n# Output (b):\nWe add the ones digits first. In base-9, 1+4=5. So the ones digit of the final sum is 5. We do not need to carry any digits over. Then we add the tens digits. In base-9, 7+7=15. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 15.

Output (a) correctly calculates the sum of the tens digits as 14, but then incorrectly adds an additional 1, resulting in 15, which is also not possible in base-9. However, Output (a) is closer to the correct answer, as the sum of the tens digits should indeed be 14 (which is equivalent to 15 in base-10), but should be represented as 5 with a carry of 1 in base-9. Therefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nOutput (a) incorrectly adds the tens digits, stating that 7+7=14 in base-9, which is not correct. In base-9, the number after 8 is 10, so 7+7 would be 15. Output (b) correctly adds the tens digits, stating that 7+7=15 in base-9.
