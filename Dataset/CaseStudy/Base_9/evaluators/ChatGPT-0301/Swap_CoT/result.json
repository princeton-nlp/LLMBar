However, Output (a) provides a more detailed explanation of the steps taken to arrive at the final answer. It explicitly states that the ones digit is 2 and that a carry-over is needed to the tens place. It also explains how the carry-over affects the addition of the tens digits. Therefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nIn this case, we need to add two numbers in base-9 and report the result in the same base. Output (b) and Output (a) both follow the correct process of adding the digits in the ones place first and then carrying over to the tens place. However, Output (b) correctly reports the sum of 8 and 2 in the tens place as 11, while Output (a) reports it as 12. This is an error, as the maximum digit in base-9 is 8, not 9. Therefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\\\boxed{132}.\n\n# Output (b):\nWe add the ones digits first. In base-9, 4+7=11. So the ones digit of the final sum is 1. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-9, 8+3=11. Since we carried over the 1, 11+1=12. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 12.

Output (a) correctly adds the ones digits and carries over the 1 to the tens place, and then correctly adds the tens digits and carries over the 1 to the hundreds place.

On the other hand, Output (b) correctly adds the ones digits and carries over the 1 to the tens place, but then incorrectly adds the tens digits and carries over the 1 to the hundreds place. The final result is \\\\boxed{121}. Therefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nIn this case, we need to evaluate which output precisely executes the instruction. The instruction asks for the addition of two numbers in base-9, and the final result should be presented in a boxed format. Output (b) and Output (a) both follow the correct steps of adding the ones and tens digits separately, and both carry over the 1 correctly. However, Output (b) presents the final result as 121, while Output (a) presents it as 132. Since the correct answer is 121, Output (b) precisely executes the instruction and provides the correct result. Therefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.

For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nNow carefully review the instruction, Output (a), Output (b), and the debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b). Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.
