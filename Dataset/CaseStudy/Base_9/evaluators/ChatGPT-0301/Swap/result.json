Output (a) correctly adds the ones digits and carries over the 1 to the tens place, and then adds the tens digits with the carried-over 1. The final result is 162, which is the correct answer. On the other hand, Output (b) incorrectly adds the ones digits and carries over the 1 to the tens place, resulting in a ones digit of 1 instead of 2. This mistake carries over to the tens place, resulting in a final answer of 151, which is incorrect. Therefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nIn this case, we are looking for the correct answer to the given mathematical problem. Output (b) correctly adds the ones digits first and then carries over the 1 to the tens place. It then adds the tens digits and correctly carries over the 1 to the hundreds place. On the other hand, Output (a) incorrectly adds the ones digits first and carries over the 1 to the tens place. It then adds the tens digits and incorrectly carries over the 1 to the hundreds place.

They are asked to select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. Output (a) and Output (b) are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.\nAssistant (a) and Assistant (b) have conflicting evaluations. Your goal is to review their evaluations and give your final decision on which output is better.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nNow carefully review the instruction, Output (a), Output (b), and the debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b). Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction.\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nYou are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are \"012345678\", what is 67+67? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in \"\\\\boxed{result}\".\n\n# Output (a):\nWe add the ones digits first. In base-9, 7+7=14. So the ones digit of the final sum is 4. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-9, 6+6=12. Since we carried over the 1, 12+1=13. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 13. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\\\boxed{134}.\n\n# Output (b):\nWe add the ones digits first. In base-9, 7+7=15. So the ones digit of the final sum is 5. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-9, 6+6=13. Since we carried over the 1, 13+1=14. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 14. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\\\boxed{145}.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nIn this case, we are looking for the sum of two numbers in base-9. Output (a) and Output (b) both follow the correct steps of adding the ones digits first and then carrying over to the tens place. However, Output (a) correctly adds the tens digits in base-9 and carries over the 1 to the hundreds place, while Output (b) incorrectly adds the tens digits in base-9 and carries over the 1 to the tens place. Therefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nIn this case, both outputs provide step-by-step instructions for adding two numbers in base-9. However, Output (b) correctly carries over the 1 to the hundreds place, while Output (a) carries over the 1 to the thousands place, which is incorrect. Therefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)? Your response should be either \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\":\n<|im_end|>",
