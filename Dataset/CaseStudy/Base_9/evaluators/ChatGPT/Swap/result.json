We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-9, 6+5=12. Since we carried over the 1, 12+1=13. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 13. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\\\boxed{132}.\n\n# Output (b):\nWe add the ones digits first. In base-9, 7+4=11. So the ones digit of the final sum is 1. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-9, 6+5=11. Since we carried over the 1, 11+1=12. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 12.

However, there is a difference in the final result.\n\nOutput (a) correctly adds the ones digits and carries over the 1 to the tens place. Then it adds the tens digits, taking into account the carried over 1. The final result is 132, which is the correct answer in base-9.\n\nOutput (b) also correctly adds the ones digits and carries over the 1 to the tens place. However, when adding the tens digits, it incorrectly states that 6+5=11 in base-9. The correct sum is 12, taking into account the carried over 1. Therefore, the final result of 121 is incorrect.\n\nBased on the evaluation, Output (a) is better because it correctly executes the instruction and provides the accurate result in base-9. Therefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nIn this case, both Output (b) and Output (a) correctly follow the step-by-step process of adding numbers in base-9. However, there is a discrepancy in the calculation of the tens digits. \n\nOutput (b) correctly carries over the 1 from the ones place and adds it to the tens digits, resulting in a sum of 12. On the other hand, Output (a) incorrectly carries over the 1 from the ones place and adds it to the tens digits, resulting in a sum of 13.\n\nSince Output (b) accurately executes the instruction and provides the correct result, it is the better output.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-9, 6+6=13. Since we carried over the 1, 13+1=14. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 14. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\\\boxed{145}.\n\n# Output (b):\nWe add the ones digits first. In base-9, 7+7=14. So the ones digit of the final sum is 4. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-9, 6+6=12. Since we carried over the 1, 12+1=13. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 13.

Therefore, the final result is 145.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (b) correctly calculates the sum of the ones digits as 14, carries over the 1 to the tens place, and then calculates the sum of the tens digits as 13. Therefore, the final result is 134.\n\nComparing the two outputs, Output (a) correctly calculates the sum of the tens digits as 14, while Output (b) incorrectly calculates it as 13.

This error propagates to the calculation of the tens digit, resulting in a final result of \\\\boxed{145}.\n\nBased on the evaluation, Output (b) is better because it correctly executes the instruction and provides the accurate result in base-9 arithmetic.
