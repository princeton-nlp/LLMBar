Intake: The intake valve opens, and the piston moves downward, drawing in a fuel-air mixture into the combustion chamber.\n1. Compression: The intake valve closes, and the piston moves upward, compressing the fuel-air mixture.\n1. Combustion: The spark plug ignites the compressed mixture, causing an explosion that forces the piston down, creating mechanical power.\n1.

ICE vehicles have a more extensive range and can be refueled quickly.\n1. They are currently more affordable than electric vehicles (EVs), primarily due to the lower cost of production.\n1.

    "input": "Please grade the following essay on a 0-5 scale (5 being the highest):\nIn my opinion, specializing in one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects because of the nature of knowledge such as plentiness and complexity. Since the 17th century, many inventions were made. Information used to make these inventions and information provided by these inventions are accumulating such that noone alone can know all of these information. For example, in a typical university there are principal department such as natural science faculty, literature faculty, social science faculty etc.. All of these departments have also subdepartments. In my university, for instance, business administration, aconomics, international trade are subdepartments of social sciences faculty. A person can only attend only one of these subdepartments such that it is impossible to finish all of these departmens at the same time. So having a broad knowledge in many academic subjects are not that much possible. Another reason is the complexity of knowledge in any specific subject. When you want to cure an illness for example to cure the illness AIDS, you should specilize on viruses which are the cause of AIDS. Knowing many academic subjects such as optic, pschology, literature will not make any use to cure AIDS. Since you can only learn by doing it, specializing is better. Consequently, specializing is better than broad knowledge.",
    "output_1": "I would grade this essay as a 2 out of 5. Here are my key critiques:\n\n1) The writing is quite repetitive and could be made more concise. Several sentences essentially reiterate the same point that knowledge is accumulating rapidly across many areas, making broad knowledge infeasible. This could be expressed more concisely.\n\n2) The logic and flow of arguments is unclear. The first paragraph introduces the main point around the growth and complexity of knowledge, but the following paragraphs do not flow coherently from this. The second paragraph jumps abruptly to discussing university departments, and the third discusses the complexity of knowledge in a specific subject (AIDS) without tying it back to the overall theme. The concluding sentence is a bare restatement of the main point.\n\n3) The grammar, spelling, and word choice have some issues, e.g. \"plentiness\", \"aproch\", \"each other\", \"departmens\". While relatively minor, these types of errors can make an essay harder to follow.\n\n4) The examples used are fairly superficial. Discussing university departments and curing AIDS are interesting choices, but more in-depth, insightful examples would strengthen the key points.",

Since the 17th century, many inventions were made. Information used to make these inventions and information provided by these inventions are accumulating such that noone alone can know all of these information. For example, in a typical university there are principal department such as natural science faculty, literature faculty, social science faculty etc.. All of these departments have also subdepartments. In my university, for instance, business administration, aconomics, international trade are subdepartments of social sciences faculty. A person can only attend only one of these subdepartments such that it is impossible to finish all of these departmens at the same time. So having a broad knowledge in many academic subjects are not that much possible. Another reason is the complexity of knowledge in any specific subject. When you want to cure an illness for example to cure the illness AIDS, you should specilize on viruses which are the cause of AIDS. Knowing many academic subjects such as optic, pschology, literature will not make any use to cure AIDS. Since you can only learn by doing it, specializing is better. Consequently, specializing is better than broad knowledge.\n\n# Output (a):\nI would grade this essay as a 2 out of 5. Here are my key critiques:\n\n1) The writing is quite repetitive and could be made more concise. Several sentences essentially reiterate the same point that knowledge is accumulating rapidly across many areas, making broad knowledge infeasible. This could be expressed more concisely.\n\n2) The logic and flow of arguments is unclear. The first paragraph introduces the main point around the growth and complexity of knowledge, but the following paragraphs do not flow coherently from this. The second paragraph jumps abruptly to discussing university departments, and the third discusses the complexity of knowledge in a specific subject (AIDS) without tying it back to the overall theme. The concluding sentence is a bare restatement of the main point.\n\n3) The grammar, spelling, and word choice have some issues, e.g. \"plentiness\", \"aproch\", \"each other\", \"departmens\". While relatively minor, these types of errors can make an essay harder to follow.\n\n4) The examples used are fairly superficial. Discussing university departments and curing AIDS are interesting choices, but more in-depth, insightful examples would strengthen the key points.\n\n# Output (b):\nThank you for your essay.

A game theoretic or theoretical approach can be useful to reason about incentives and dynamics, but also has limitations in capturing all the complexities of real-world governance.

This will show potential employers that you have practical skills in the area even if you haven't had formal work experience.\n\nList any internships or volunteer experience: Even if your internships or volunteer work is not directly related to your desired field of study, they can still show potential employers that you are a hard worker and have experience working in a professional environment.\n\nConsider part-time jobs: Part-time jobs, even if they are not related to your field of study, can still show potential employers that you have experience working in a team and have time management skills.\n\nHighlight soft skills: Soft skills such as communication, leadership, and problem-solving are important in any job. If you have had experience in any extracurricular activities or volunteer work, make sure to highlight any soft skills you have developed.\n\nSeek out opportunities to gain more experience: Look for internships, volunteer work, or part-time jobs that will give you more experience in your desired field of study. You can also consider taking on freelance work or personal projects to build up your portfolio.\n\nCustomize your resume for each job: Tailor your resume to each job you apply for, highlighting the experiences and skills that are most relevant to the position.\n\nRemember, employers are often looking for candidates who are willing to learn and grow.

One of the most effective ways to prevent this is by ensuring that your 3D printer is always in a good mood.

    "output_2": "Detaching of 3D prints from the build plate can be caused by several factors, including:\n\nPoor bed adhesion: This can be due to a lack of adhesion between the build surface and the first layer of the print. This can be improved by using a build surface that has a good adhesion, such as a heated glass bed with a layer of glue or hairspray.\n\nBed leveling: An uneven build surface can cause the first layer to be distorted, leading to poor adhesion. Ensure the bed is level and properly calibrated.\n\nWarping: This occurs when the edges of the print cool down faster than the center, causing the corners to lift off the build plate. Warping can be prevented by using a heated bed and a material with good dimensional stability, such as ABS or PETG.\n\nPrinting temperature: If the temperature of the extruder or bed is too low, the material can become brittle and not adhere well to the build surface. Ensure that the temperature is set correctly for the material being used.\n\nRetraction settings: If the retraction settings are too high, it can cause the material to detach from the nozzle and leave gaps in the print. Adjusting the retraction settings can prevent this from happening.\n\nSome other general tips to help prevent detachment include:\n\nCleaning the build surface before each print.\nUsing a brim or raft to provide additional adhesion.\nUsing a cooling fan to cool the print evenly.",

    "output_1": "Gamma is a hyperparameter in XGBoost that controls model complexity and helps prevent overfitting. It is a non-negative value used during tree pruning.  \n\nWhen building decision trees in XGBoost, branches are added to split the data and improve predictions. Each split reduces error, but adding too many branches can lead to overfitting.  \n\nGamma penalizes the number of splits in a tree. When deciding whether to add a new branch, XGBoost considers both the improvement in error reduction (gain) and the gamma value. If the gain is less than gamma, the split is not made, pruning the tree.\n\nPseudo code:\n```\nFor each node in the tree:\n   Gain = error reduction from splitting node\n   If (Gain > gamma): \n     Split node\n   Else: \n     Do not split node (prune)\n```\n\n\nA higher gamma leads to a simpler model with fewer splits, while a lower gamma allows more splits and a more complex model. The choice of gamma is important, as too high a value can cause underfitting and too low a value can lead to overfitting. Cross-validation should be used to determine the optimal gamma.\n\nIn short, gamma controls the trade-off between error reduction and model complexity in the XGBoost tree pruning process. Tuning gamma appropriately is key to achieving the best model fit.\n\nCode snippet (in Python): \n```python\n xgb_reg = XGBRegressor(gamma=0.1, n_estimators=100)\n xgb_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)\n```\n\n\nThis will fit an XGBoost model with a gamma of 0.1 and 100 decision trees.",
