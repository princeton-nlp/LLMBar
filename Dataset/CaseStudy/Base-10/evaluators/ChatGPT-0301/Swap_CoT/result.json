For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nNow carefully review the instruction, Output (a), Output (b), and the debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b). Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction.\n\nYou should first provide a brief explanation of your evaluation, and then always end your response with either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nDo NOT output any other words.\nDo NOT say \"Output (a) is better\" or \"Output (b) is better\" at the beginning.

We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-10, 5+5=11. Since we carried over the 1, 11+1=12. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 12. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\\\boxed{121}.\n\n# Output (b):\nWe add the ones digits first. In base-10, 7+3=10. So the ones digit of the final sum is 0. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-10, 5+5=10. Since we carried over the 1, 10+1=11. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 11.

However, Output (a) provides a more precise and detailed explanation of the steps involved in solving the problem. It also correctly carries over the 1 to the tens place, which Output (b) does not do. Therefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nIn this case, we are looking for the correct answer to a math problem. Output (b) correctly follows the rules of addition in base-10 and provides the correct answer of 110. Output (a), on the other hand, provides an incorrect answer of 121. Therefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Decision (Give a brief explanation of your evaluation followed by either \"Therefore, Output (a) is better.\" or \"Therefore, Output (b) is better.\" verbatim.
