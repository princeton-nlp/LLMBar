In particular, Output (a) explicitly states that the ones digit of the final sum is 0, and that the tens digit is 11, which is a result of carrying over the 1 from the ones place. This explanation is more detailed and easier to follow than Output (b), which simply states that the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 12 without providing a clear explanation of how that result was obtained.\n\nFurthermore, Output (a) correctly places the digits of the final sum in the correct order, with the ones digit being 0, and the tens digit being 11.
