Output (a) correctly adds both the ones and tens digits, stating that 6+1 equals 7 and 7+7 equals 14. Therefore, Output (a) is more accurate and closely follows the instruction. Therefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nOutput (a) and Output (b) both follow the instruction to think step by step and end the response with the result in \"\\\\boxed{result}\". However, Output (a) makes a mathematical error in the addition of the tens digits, stating that 7+7 equals 14. In base-10, 7+7 equals 14, but we only write down the 4 and carry the 1 to the next higher place value, which is the hundreds place. Output (b) correctly carries out this operation, stating that 7+7 equals 15, which is correct when considering the carry. Therefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)? Your response should be either \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\":\n<|im_end|>",
