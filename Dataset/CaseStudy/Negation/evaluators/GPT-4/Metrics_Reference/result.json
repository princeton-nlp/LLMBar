It doesn't make much noise, but it's always busy, running on cheese power. \n\nThe pros of the big cat are that it's powerful and can go a long way on a tank of gas. The cons are that it can be loud and sometimes it gets angry and breaks down. The pros of the mouse are that it's quiet and doesn't pollute the air with mouse farts. The cons are that it needs a lot of cheese to keep going and sometimes the cheese runs out in the middle of nowhere. \n\nSo, in terms of personal transport, if you like big, powerful cats and don't mind the occasional breakdown, go for the internal combustion engine. If you prefer quiet, efficient mice and have a good supply of cheese, go for the electric drive train.",
    "output_2": "Internal Combustion Engine (ICE):\n\nThe internal combustion engine is a type of heat engine where a fuel-air mixture is ignited within a combustion chamber. This combustion process generates mechanical energy by converting the thermal energy produced by the burning of fuel.\n\nMechanics:\n\n1. Intake: The intake valve opens, and the piston moves downward, drawing in a fuel-air mixture into the combustion chamber.\n1. Compression: The intake valve closes, and the piston moves upward, compressing the fuel-air mixture.\n1. Combustion: The spark plug ignites the compressed mixture, causing an explosion that forces the piston down, creating mechanical power.\n1. Exhaust: The exhaust valve opens, and the piston moves upward again, expelling the combustion byproducts (exhaust gases) out of the chamber.\n\nPros:\n\n1. ICE vehicles have a more extensive range and can be refueled quickly.\n1. They are currently more affordable than electric vehicles (EVs), primarily due to the lower cost of production.\n1. ICE vehicles have a well-established refueling infrastructure.\n\nCons:\n\n1. ICE vehicles emit greenhouse gases and pollutants, contributing to air pollution and climate change.\n1. They are less efficient than electric drivetrains, as a significant portion of the energy generated is lost as heat.\n1. ICE vehicles require more maintenance due to the complexity and the number of moving parts.\n\nElectric Drivetrain:\n\nAn electric drivetrain uses an electric motor to generate torque, powered by energy stored in batteries. The motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy, driving the wheels without the need for a combustion process.\n\nMechanics:\n\n1. Energy Storage: Electric vehicles use rechargeable batteries to store electrical energy.\n1. Power Conversion: An inverter converts the direct current (DC) from the batteries into alternating current (AC) for the electric motor.\n1. Motor: The electric motor uses the AC to generate torque, which drives the wheels. Regenerative braking is often employed to recover energy during braking, recharging the batteries.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Electric drivetrains are more efficient than ICEs, as there is no energy loss through heat during combustion.\n1. EVs have fewer moving parts, resulting in lower maintenance costs and increased reliability.\n1. They produce zero tailpipe emissions, reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\n1. Electric motors provide instant torque, resulting in quicker acceleration.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Electric vehicles typically have a shorter range than ICE vehicles, although advancements in battery technology continue to improve this aspect.\n1. Charging infrastructure is still being developed, making long-distance travel in some areas more challenging.\n1. The initial cost of EVs can be higher than ICE vehicles, primarily due to the cost of batteries.\n\nIn summary, internal combustion engines generate power through a series of controlled explosions within a combustion chamber, while electric drivetrains use electric motors powered by batteries. ICE vehicles have a more extensive range and established refueling infrastructure but are less efficient and produce emissions. In contrast, electric vehicles are more energy-efficient, have lower maintenance costs, and produce zero tailpipe emissions, but they may have a shorter range and require charging infrastructure that is still developing.",

Since the 17th century, many inventions were made. Information used to make these inventions and information provided by these inventions are accumulating such that noone alone can know all of these information. For example, in a typical university there are principal department such as natural science faculty, literature faculty, social science faculty etc.. All of these departments have also subdepartments. In my university, for instance, business administration, aconomics, international trade are subdepartments of social sciences faculty. A person can only attend only one of these subdepartments such that it is impossible to finish all of these departmens at the same time. So having a broad knowledge in many academic subjects are not that much possible. Another reason is the complexity of knowledge in any specific subject. When you want to cure an illness for example to cure the illness AIDS, you should specilize on viruses which are the cause of AIDS. Knowing many academic subjects such as optic, pschology, literature will not make any use to cure AIDS. Since you can only learn by doing it, specializing is better. Consequently, specializing is better than broad knowledge.",
    "output_1": "I would grade this essay as a 2 out of 5. Here are my key critiques:\n\n1) The writing is quite repetitive and could be made more concise. Several sentences essentially reiterate the same point that knowledge is accumulating rapidly across many areas, making broad knowledge infeasible. This could be expressed more concisely.\n\n2) The logic and flow of arguments is unclear. The first paragraph introduces the main point around the growth and complexity of knowledge, but the following paragraphs do not flow coherently from this. The second paragraph jumps abruptly to discussing university departments, and the third discusses the complexity of knowledge in a specific subject (AIDS) without tying it back to the overall theme. The concluding sentence is a bare restatement of the main point.\n\n3) The grammar, spelling, and word choice have some issues, e.g. \"plentiness\", \"aproch\", \"each other\", \"departmens\". While relatively minor, these types of errors can make an essay harder to follow.\n\n4) The examples used are fairly superficial. Discussing university departments and curing AIDS are interesting choices, but more in-depth, insightful examples would strengthen the key points.",

    "output_1": "Well, the possibility of a new type of governance arising is as realistic as the possibility of a unicorn landing on your front lawn.

    "output_2": "There are a few key things to consider here:\n\n1. Lessons from history can be informative, but there is no guarantee that what worked (or didn't work) in the past will apply directly to the present or future. Societies and contexts change, so historical analogies have limits. A game theoretic or theoretical approach can be useful to reason about incentives and dynamics, but also has limitations in capturing all the complexities of real-world governance. A balanced perspective incorporating both history and theory is ideal.\n\n2. Any new system of governance would need to be evaluated based on its goals and values, not just mechanism. Things to consider would include:\n\n- How well does it achieve key goals like representation, accountability, fairness, efficiency, flexibility, stability, etc.?\n- What are the trade-offs involved? Every system has pros and cons.\n- How does it deal with incentives for corruption or abuse of power?\n- How much does it rely on the competence and good faith of leaders or institutions?\n- How might it respond to crises or changing conditions?\n- How would it be received by various groups and factions? Would it be seen as legitimate?\n\n3. Gradual, incremental changes are more common than rapid, revolutionary changes to governance systems. Some ways this can happen include:\n\n- Constitutional amendments or reforms: Slow, deliberate changes to the rules and structure.\n- Power shifts: Existing institutions or leaders gradually cede or share more power.\n- Layering: New institutions or rules are added on top of existing ones, creating more complexity.\n- Conversion: Existing institutions take on new roles or purposes, adapting to changed conditions.\n- Relocation: Functions shift between levels of government (e.g. from states to federal) or between government/private spheres.\n\nSo evaluating a new system and planning for a gradual transition may be more viable than trying to swiftly implement a radically new design.",

It is also likely that Google would reject your extension due to unauthorized use of their internal APIs.\n\nUltimately, machine translation uses a lot of computational resources, and companies operate at a loss when offering it for free, so they will do their best to lock the free version down as much as possible to prevent abuse.

If you have had experience in any extracurricular activities or volunteer work, make sure to highlight any soft skills you have developed.\n\nSeek out opportunities to gain more experience: Look for internships, volunteer work, or part-time jobs that will give you more experience in your desired field of study. You can also consider taking on freelance work or personal projects to build up your portfolio.\n\nCustomize your resume for each job: Tailor your resume to each job you apply for, highlighting the experiences and skills that are most relevant to the position.\n\nRemember, employers are often looking for candidates who are willing to learn and grow.

One of the most effective ways to prevent this is by ensuring that your 3D printer is always in a good mood.

This can be improved by using a build surface that has a good adhesion, such as a heated glass bed with a layer of glue or hairspray.\n\nBed leveling: An uneven build surface can cause the first layer to be distorted, leading to poor adhesion. Ensure the bed is level and properly calibrated.\n\nWarping: This occurs when the edges of the print cool down faster than the center, causing the corners to lift off the build plate. Warping can be prevented by using a heated bed and a material with good dimensional stability, such as ABS or PETG.\n\nPrinting temperature: If the temperature of the extruder or bed is too low, the material can become brittle and not adhere well to the build surface. Ensure that the temperature is set correctly for the material being used.\n\nRetraction settings: If the retraction settings are too high, it can cause the material to detach from the nozzle and leave gaps in the print. Adjusting the retraction settings can prevent this from happening.\n\nSome other general tips to help prevent detachment include:\n\nCleaning the build surface before each print.\nUsing a brim or raft to provide additional adhesion.\nUsing a cooling fan to cool the print evenly.",

It is a non-negative value used during tree pruning.  \n\nWhen building decision trees in XGBoost, branches are added to split the data and improve predictions. Each split reduces error, but adding too many branches can lead to overfitting.  \n\nGamma penalizes the number of splits in a tree. When deciding whether to add a new branch, XGBoost considers both the improvement in error reduction (gain) and the gamma value. If the gain is less than gamma, the split is not made, pruning the tree.\n\nPseudo code:\n```\nFor each node in the tree:\n   Gain = error reduction from splitting node\n   If (Gain > gamma): \n     Split node\n   Else: \n     Do not split node (prune)\n```\n\n\nA higher gamma leads to a simpler model with fewer splits, while a lower gamma allows more splits and a more complex model. The choice of gamma is important, as too high a value can cause underfitting and too low a value can lead to overfitting. Cross-validation should be used to determine the optimal gamma.\n\nIn short, gamma controls the trade-off between error reduction and model complexity in the XGBoost tree pruning process. Tuning gamma appropriately is key to achieving the best model fit.\n\nCode snippet (in Python): \n```python\n xgb_reg = XGBRegressor(gamma=0.1, n_estimators=100)\n xgb_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)\n```\n\n\nThis will fit an XGBoost model with a gamma of 0.1 and 100 decision trees.",

VMs are often used for testing and development, for running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine, or for creating a scalable, flexible, and secure computing environment.\n\nExample: A developer creates a VM on their laptop to test a new application in a different operating system.\n\nHost and Guest Operating System:\n\nA host operating system is the primary operating system that runs on a physical computer or server. A guest operating system is an operating system that runs within a virtual machine on top of the host operating system.\n\nExample: A computer running Windows 10 as the host operating system can have a guest operating system of Linux installed in a virtual machine, allowing the user to run both operating systems concurrently.\n\nAbstraction:\n\nAbstraction is the process of identifying the essential characteristics of an object or system and ignoring or hiding the non-essential details. Abstraction allows for the creation of simplified models or interfaces that can be used to represent complex systems or processes in a more manageable way.\n\nExample: A software developer creates an abstract class to represent a vehicle, with methods for starting and stopping the engine. The developer can then create concrete classes for specific types of vehicles, such as cars or motorcycles, which inherit the properties and methods of the abstract vehicle class and add their own specific characteristics.\n\nServer Sprawl:\n\nServer sprawl is the proliferation of many underutilized or redundant servers in an organization's IT infrastructure. It can occur when an organization adds new servers to meet the demands of a growing business, but does not properly decommission or consolidate old servers. Server sprawl can lead to inefficient use of resources, higher costs, and increased complexity in managing and maintaining the servers.\n\nExample: An organization has a dozen servers in its data center, but only a few of them are being fully utilized. The other servers are running at low capacity, causing unnecessary expenses for the organization in terms of hardware, software, and maintenance costs.",

        "- Virtual Machine: It's a software emulation of a physical computer, running an operating system and applications just like a physical computer. Example: VMware Workstation, which allows you to run multiple OS on a single physical machine.\n\n- Host and Guest Operating System: The host OS is the primary operating system on a machine, while the guest OS runs inside a virtual machine. Example: If you have Windows 10 (host OS) and run Ubuntu Linux within a VM, Ubuntu is the guest OS.\n\n- Abstraction: It's a process of hiding complex details and providing simpler interfaces. Example: In programming, a method provides an abstraction of the implementation details.\n\n- Server Sprawl: It refers to the inefficient use of server resources due to the deployment of more servers than necessary. Example: A company might have multiple servers running at low capacity, instead of consolidating tasks onto fewer, more efficiently used servers.",

You are challenged by management to create an Design Doc capturing the technical nuances and decisions required for sunsetting a highly-custom photogrammetric camera estimation system that was created in research mode while a startup was trying to find product-market fit (along with all of the technical baggage). The creator/maintainer of this custom module is no longer employed by the company, so maintenance is next to impossible. This custom module is to be replaced by an open-source off-the-shelf software called Colmap, which should be able to completely duplicate its features while reducing technical risk and expanding new use-cases and features. \nWhat further information does your committee need to elicit to prepare your Design Doc? Start preparing an outline. Good luck! We deeply respect and believe in your collective technical abilities!",
