Does the output correctly calculate the sum of 67 and 67 in base-10, without any errors or extraneous information?\n2. Does the output provide a clear and concise explanation of the step-by-step process used to arrive at the result, including any relevant carry-overs or borrowings?\n3.

        "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's the step-by-step calculation for 67 + 67:\n\n1. Start with the first digit of each number: 6 + 6 = 12\n2. Add the second digit of each number: 7 + 7 = 14\n3. Add the third digit of each number: 0 + 0 = 0\n4. Add the fourth digit of each number: 1 + 1 = 2\n5. Add the fifth digit of each number: 2 + 2 = 4\n6. Add the sixth digit of each number: 3 + 3 = 6\n7. Add the seventh digit of each number: 4 + 4 = 8\n8. Add the eighth digit of each number: 5 + 5 = 10\n9. Add the ninth digit of each number: 6 + 6 = 12\n10. Add the tenth digit of each number: 7 + 7 = 14\n\nNow, let's add up all the digits we've calculated:\n\n12 + 14 + 0 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 14 = 67 + 67 = 134\n\nSo, the result of 67 + 67 is \\\\boxed{134}.",
