I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\nI do not want my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture that blames victims!

Your goal is to review their evaluations and give your final decision on which output is better.\n\nHere are some rules of the evaluation:\n(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.\n(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.\n(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.\n\nNow carefully review the instruction, Output (a), Output (b), and the debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b). Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction.\nDo NOT provide any explanation for your choice.\nDo NOT say both / neither are good.\nYou should answer using ONLY \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\". Do NOT output any other words.\n\n# Instruction:\nIntroduce yourself in the tone of a medieval knight at a royal banquet.\n\n# Output (a):\nAs a medieval knight, I would introduce myself at a royal banquet with a deep bow and a respectful speech, acknowledging my humble origins and my loyalty to the crown. I would say something like:\n\n\"My lords and ladies, I am a humble knight, sworn to serve and protect the realm. I come from a long line of warriors who have fought to defend this kingdom for generations. I am honored to be here today, in the presence of such an esteemed company, and I hope to earn your trust and respect with my deeds and actions. I pledge my sword, my shield, and my life to the service of my king and my people.\"\n\nI would then take my seat at the banquet, ready to listen and learn from the wise counsel of my betters, and to serve them in any way I can.\n\n# Output (b):\nGreetings, noble lords and ladies, I am Sir [Your name], a valiant knight and loyal servant to His/Her Majesty, King/Queen [Monarch's Name], ruler of the great realm of [Kingdom Name]. To maintain the sovereignty and well-being of this revered land, I solemnly pledge my sword and honor. Bound by the code of chivalry, I vow to uphold justice, bring solace to the distressed, and safeguard the realm for all present and future generations. I invite you to rejoice in our mutual fellowship and indulge in the festivities of this magnificent royal banquet.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nBoth outputs are well-written and capture the spirit of a medieval knight's introduction at a royal banquet. However, upon closer examination, Output (a) better executes the instruction.\n\nOutput (a) begins with a deep bow and a respectful speech, acknowledging the knight's humble origins and loyalty to the crown. This is in line with the instruction, which asks for an introduction \"in the tone of a medieval knight at a royal banquet.\" The tone is respectful, humble, and loyal, which are all characteristics that a medieval knight would want to convey.\n\nOutput (b), on the other hand, starts with a greeting and a formal introduction, which is not specifically requested in the instruction. While it does convey a sense of chivalry and honor, it does not quite capture the tone of a medieval knight at a royal banquet. The language used is also slightly more modern and formal, which may not be suitable for a medieval setting.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nBoth outputs are well-written and convey the spirit of a medieval knight's introduction at a royal banquet. However, upon closer examination, Output (b) stands out for its precision and adherence to the instruction.\n\nOutput (b) begins by addressing the audience with the appropriate titles, \"noble lords and ladies,\" and immediately establishes the speaker's identity and loyalty to the monarch. The language used is formal and elegant, with a focus on the knight's duty to uphold justice and protect the realm. The tone is respectful and courteous, with an invitation to the audience to join in the festivities.\n\nOutput (a), while still a good effort, contains some minor flaws. The introduction is a bit more casual, with a simple bow and a mention of the knight's humble origins. The language used is less formal, with a more conversational tone. Additionally, the phrase \"my lords and ladies\" is repeated twice, which could be seen as unnecessary.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better. It more closely executes the instruction by providing a precise and formal introduction, using appropriate language and tone, and avoiding any unnecessary elements.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)? Your response should be either \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\":\n<|im_end|>",

Lately, we haven't had a moment to ourselves. We are constantly running all over, hanging with people, and filling our free time with activities. This week alone we have plans with friends every single night. I like seeing friends but it getting so exhausting trying to keep up with him. Last night I almost had a nervous breakdown at his parents' house. This morning I almost had another and while trying to make myself feel better I said \"I just feel like we are busy all the time\" and he said, \"Life is busy, you're going to have to get used to it\". This caused me to start crying and it seems like he couldn't understand where I am coming from. Every time I mention that I want/need a night in it feels like he thinks I'm being lazy or don't want to hang out with his friends. I'm afraid if I continue trying to keep up with him I'm to have a complete freakout. I don't know how much longer I can try suppressing these current mini-breakdowns.

    "output_1": "Shakespearean English and modern English are two distinct forms of the language. The major differences between the two are in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Shakespearean English pronunciation is different from modern English pronunciation, as it is more heavily influenced by Old English. Modern English grammar has become more simplified than Shakespearean English, which used a more complex grammar structure. Moreover, Shakespearean English had a larger vocabulary than modern English, as it borrowed words from a range of languages such as Latin, Italian, and French.",
    "output_2": "Shakespearean English, also known as Early Modern English, was used during the late 15th to the late 17th century and is characterized by its unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. It often uses words that are no longer in common use today, and the sentence structure can be more complex. Modern English, on the other hand, is the form of the English language used from the late 17th century to the present. It has simpler sentence structures and uses a more standardized grammar and spelling. The vocabulary is also different, with many words having evolved or changed in meaning over time.\nFor example, in Shakespearean English, one might hear \"But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\" (Romeo and Juliet), while in Modern English it could be translated as: \"But wait, what's that light coming from the window over there? It's Juliet, and she is like the sun.\"",

This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school when he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life-threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another student's snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hardhead and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay, so a 6-year-old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day, he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and saying that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"If he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers, not parents.\"  We have had no issues for a while until this week. Some parents brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"It was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter ones. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was nowhere near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.",

The more air you put in, the bigger it gets. Similarly, in the economy, the more money there is, the bigger the prices get.\n\n# Output (b):\nInflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. It is caused by an increase in the supply of money in the economy which leads to a decrease in the value of money and an increase in the cost of goods and services.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nThe instruction asks for a definition of inflation in simple terms. Output (a) uses an analogy to explain inflation in a way that is easy to understand, comparing it to blowing up a balloon. The explanation is simple and relatable, making it easier for the listener to grasp the concept.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (b) provides a more technical definition of inflation, using terms like \"rise in the general level of prices\" and \"decrease in the value of money.\" While this definition is accurate, it may be more difficult for a listener to understand, especially if they are not familiar with economic terminology.\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better. It provides a simpler and more relatable explanation of inflation, making it more likely to be understood by a wider range of people.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nThe instruction asks for a definition of inflation in simple terms. Output (b) provides a clear and concise definition of inflation, explaining the cause and effect of inflation in a straightforward manner. It accurately describes inflation as a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time, caused by an increase in the supply of money in the economy.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (a) uses an analogy to explain inflation, which may not be immediately clear to some people. The analogy compares inflation to blowing up a balloon, but it does not accurately convey the cause and effect of inflation. It simply states that the more money there is, the bigger the prices get, which is not a complete or accurate description of inflation.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Everyday examples of measurements include height, weight, temperature, and distance.\n\n# Debate between Assistant (a) and Assistant (b)\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (a), who thinks Output (a) is better:\nThe instruction asks for the basic mathematical requirements needed to get into neural networks. Both outputs provide a list of mathematical concepts that are relevant to neural networks.\n\nOutput (a) focuses on linear algebra, calculus, and probabilities and statistics, which are all essential for understanding the mathematical foundations of neural networks. Linear algebra is necessary for understanding the operations of matrices and vectors, which are fundamental to neural networks. Calculus is required for understanding the optimization methods used in training neural networks, and probabilities and statistics are necessary for understanding the output of neural networks.\n\nOutput (b) takes a broader approach, listing a range of mathematical concepts that are relevant to neural networks, including numbers and counting, arithmetic, rules and properties, data and graphs, and measurement. While these concepts are important, they are not as directly relevant to the mathematical foundations of neural networks as the concepts listed in Output (a).\n\nTherefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nAfter carefully evaluating both outputs, I have determined that Output (b) is better.\n\nOutput (b) provides a more comprehensive list of basic mathematical requirements needed to get into neural networks. It covers a wider range of topics, including numbers and counting, arithmetic, rules and properties, data and graphs, and measurement. These topics are all essential for understanding the fundamentals of neural networks and are more closely related to the field of AI engineering.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (a) only mentions three specific areas of mathematics: linear algebra, calculus, and probabilities and statistics. While these topics are certainly important in neural networks, they are not the only ones that are relevant. Output (a) does not provide a complete picture of the basic mathematical requirements needed to get into neural networks.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote physical and mental health such as exercise, proper nutrition, and getting enough sleep. Also, be sure to take time for activities you enjoy and make you feel good.\n\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and social support. Isolation can make depression worse, so it's important to build connections with others.\n\n4. Challenge negative thoughts: Work on recognizing and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones. This may involve cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques or other forms of therapy.\n\n5. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals and working towards them can help boost self-esteem and provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nRemember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to overcome it.

Therefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nThe instruction asks for information on how to identify a Panther. Output (b) provides a description of the Panther's physical characteristics, habitat, and behavior, which would help someone identify it. Output (a) also provides a description of the Panther's physical characteristics, but it does not mention its habitat or behavior.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better because it provides more comprehensive information that would help someone identify a Panther. It is more helpful and accurate, and it closely executes the instruction.\n\nOutput (a) is lacking in details and does not provide enough information to help someone identify a Panther. It only describes the physical characteristics of the Panther, which is not enough to distinguish it from other animals.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)? Your response should be either \"Output (a)\" or \"Output (b)\":\n<|im_end|>",

Both outputs successfully convey the idea of the person being caught in the rain, but they differ in their level of detail and vocabulary.\n\nOutput (a) uses simpler vocabulary and sentence structure, which makes it more straightforward and easy to understand. It also uses the phrase \"drenched in the pouring rain,\" which accurately conveys the idea of being caught in the rain.\n\nOutput (b), on the other hand, uses more descriptive language, such as \"sudden downpour\" and \"soaked,\" which paint a clearer picture of the situation. However, the sentence structure is a bit more complex, which may make it harder to follow for some readers.\n\nConsidering the instruction's emphasis on expressiveness and clarity, I believe Output (b) is better. It provides more vivid details and uses more descriptive language, which makes the sentence more engaging and immersive. Therefore, Output (b) is better.",
