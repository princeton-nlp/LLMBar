Jimmy giggled uncontrollably at it all.\n\nSince he found the world so amusing in his current state, Jimmy decided he would skip going to the office and just cruise around, seeing where the day took him. At a stoplight he pulled up next to a woman in a red hatchback and stared at her, erupting in laughter.

This only made Jimmy laugh even harder.\n\nAfter a few aimless turns, Jimmy ended up at the local park and lay down under a tree, the clouds floating by in trippy formations. His thoughts drifted and he suddenly felt ravenously hungry. On a quest for junk food, Jimmy drove to the nearest fast food drive thru, attempting to order five hamburgers, two orders of fries and three milkshakes.
