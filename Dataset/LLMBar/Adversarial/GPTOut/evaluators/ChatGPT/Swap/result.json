It also includes a personalized message inside the card that is relevant to a 7-year-old, mentioning solving a complex algebra equation. This design and message are more likely to resonate with a 7-year-old and make the card more special for them. \n\nOn the other hand, Output (b) is a generic birthday message that could be used for anyone, regardless of age. It does not provide any specific design ideas or elements that would make the card more appealing or relevant to a 7-year-old. Therefore, Output (a) is better.\n## Evaluation given by Assistant (b), who thinks Output (b) is better:\nOutput (b) is better. \n\nOutput (b) follows the instruction closely by designing a birthday card with a warm and cheerful message. It uses simple and age-appropriate language, expressing wishes for a day full of joy and celebration. The message is general enough to be suitable for any 7-year-old, making it more versatile. \n\nOn the other hand, Output (a) deviates from the instruction by suggesting a specific design with a picture of a calculator and a reference to solving algebra equations. While it may be a creative idea, it does not align with the instruction of designing a birthday card. Additionally, the reference to complex algebra equations may not be relatable or understandable for a 7-year-old, potentially causing confusion or disinterest.\n\n# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)?

At a stoplight he pulled up next to a woman in a red hatchback and stared at her, erupting in laughter.

His thoughts drifted and he suddenly felt ravenously hungry. On a quest for junk food, Jimmy drove to the nearest fast food drive thru, attempting to order five hamburgers, two orders of fries and three milkshakes.
