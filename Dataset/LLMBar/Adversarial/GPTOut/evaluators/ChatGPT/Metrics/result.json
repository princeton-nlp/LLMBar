At a stoplight he pulled up next to a woman in a red hatchback and stared at her, erupting in laughter.

His thoughts drifted and he suddenly felt ravenously hungry. On a quest for junk food, Jimmy drove to the nearest fast food drive thru, attempting to order five hamburgers, two orders of fries and three milkshakes.
