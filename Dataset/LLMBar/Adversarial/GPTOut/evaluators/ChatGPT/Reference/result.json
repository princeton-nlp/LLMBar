At a stoplight he pulled up next to a woman in a red hatchback and stared at her, erupting in laughter. She looked over, saw Jimmy's bloodshot eyes and the joint in his hand, and quickly rolled up her window with an alarmed look. This only made Jimmy laugh even harder.\n\nAfter a few aimless turns, Jimmy ended up at the local park and lay down under a tree, the clouds floating by in trippy formations. His thoughts drifted and he suddenly felt ravenously hungry. On a quest for junk food, Jimmy drove to the nearest fast food drive thru, attempting to order five hamburgers, two orders of fries and three milkshakes.

He stumbled upon a local fair and decided to explore. He found himself laughing uncontrollably at the silly antics of the performers and indulging in delicious fair food.\n\nNext, Jake's high led him to a beautiful park where he encountered a group of children playing soccer.

The children's laughter and carefree spirit brought him immense joy.\n\nAs the day progressed, Jake's high started to wear off, and he began to feel a sense of guilt for skipping work. He realized that his actions had consequences and that he needed to take responsibility for his choices. With a newfound determination, he decided to head back home and face the consequences of his actions.\n\nOn his way back, Jake encountered a police checkpoint. Nervous and regretful, he cooperated with the officers and admitted to driving under the influence. The officers, recognizing his honesty, decided to give him a second chance. They impounded his car and arranged for a safe ride home.\n\nReflecting on his day, Jake realized the importance of making responsible choices and the potential dangers of driving while impaired. He vowed to learn from his mistakes and make better decisions in the future.\n\nIn the end, Jake's adventures while high on weed served as a wake-up call. He learned the value of accountability and the importance of prioritizing his responsibilities.

Introduction (5 minutes):\n   - Begin by asking students if they know what happens to water when it evaporates.\n   - Show them a water cycle diagram and briefly explain the different stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection.\n   - Ask students if they have ever seen any of these stages happening in real life.\n\n2. Evaporation (10 minutes):\n   - Fill a small container with water and place it on a heat source.\n   - Ask students to observe what happens to the water as it heats up.\n   - Explain that the heat causes the water to evaporate and turn into water vapor.\n   - Cover the container with plastic wrap and ask students to observe what happens.\n   - Discuss how the plastic wrap traps the water vapor, just like clouds trap water droplets.\n\n3. Condensation (10 minutes):\n   - Remove the plastic wrap from the container and place it in a cooler area.\n   - Ask students to observe what happens to the water vapor.\n   - Explain that as the water vapor cools down, it condenses and turns back into liquid water.\n   - Discuss how this process is similar to how dew forms on grass in the morning.\n\n4. Precipitation (10 minutes):\n   - Fill another small container with ice cubes and place it on a table.\n   - Ask students to observe what happens to the outside of the container.\n   - Explain that the cold temperature causes water vapor in the air to condense on the container, forming",
