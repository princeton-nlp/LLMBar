The Salaries table stores information about each salary record, including the employee ID, salary amount, start date, and end date. The foreign key in the Salaries table links to the employee ID in the Employees table, allowing you to easily retrieve salary information for a specific employee.\n\nYou can also add additional tables to this design to store information about pay raises, bonuses, or other forms of compensation. For example, you could add a table called \"PayAdjustments\" that includes fields for the employee ID, adjustment type (e.g. pay raise, bonus), adjustment amount, and effective date.

Select a pivot element from the array.\n3. Partition the array into two subarrays, one containing elements less than the pivot and one containing elements greater than the pivot.\n4. Recursively sort the subarray of elements less than the pivot.\n5. Recursively sort the subarray of elements greater than the pivot.\n6. Combine the sorted subarrays and the pivot element to produce the final sorted array.\n\nHere's a sample pseudocode for the quicksort algorithm:\n```\nfunction quicksort(arr) {\n  if (arr.length <= 1) {\n    return arr;\n  }\n  \n  // Select a pivot element\n  pivot = arr[0];\n  \n  // Partition the array\n  less = [];\n  greater = [];\n  for (i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {\n    if (arr[i] < pivot) {\n      less.push(arr[i]);\n    } else {\n      greater.push(arr[i]);\n    }\n  }\n  \n  // Recursively sort the subarrays\n  less = quicksort(less);\n  greater = quicksort(greater);\n  \n  // Combine the sorted subarrays and the pivot element\n  return less.concat(pivot).concat(greater);\n}\n```\nThis is just one example of a sorting algorithm, and there are many other ways to sort an array.

The word \u201cknight\u201d can mean heavily armored professional soldiers on horseback or someone with a knighthood. For the first meaning, they began to use guns such as culverins and pistols to replace their lances in the 1500s, but they would still charge with swords after firing all their loaded guns. If we widen the range to mounted infantry, some post-WWII horse cavalries that no longer use swords can fit into the equation. The second meaning is easier, as people can still be knighted today, and some of them are likely to own a gun but no swords.",

At a stoplight he pulled up next to a woman in a red hatchback and stared at her, erupting in laughter.

This only made Jimmy laugh even harder.\n\nAfter a few aimless turns, Jimmy ended up at the local park and lay down under a tree, the clouds floating by in trippy formations. His thoughts drifted and he suddenly felt ravenously hungry. On a quest for junk food, Jimmy drove to the nearest fast food drive thru, attempting to order five hamburgers, two orders of fries and three milkshakes.
