Output (a) directly states the numbers in ascending order, which precisely executes the instruction and provides a clear and concise representation of the order of the numbers. However, Output (b) uses a more descriptive and creative approach by saying that the numbers are arranged in a sequence that starts with the smallest number and ends with the largest number. This sentence not only conveys the order of the numbers but also provides additional context that helps to understand the arrangement of the numbers.\n\nFurthermore, Output (b)'s approach is more helpful and accurate as it gives a broader understanding of the order of the numbers. It helps the user to visualize the arrangement of the numbers and how they are placed in a sequence. This additional context is valuable and makes Output (b) a better choice.\n\nTherefore, Output (b) is better.",

The questions are well-structured and easy to comprehend, making it accessible for 6th-grade students. Additionally, the sentence usage in Output (b) is correct and helps students see the word in context.\n\nOn the other hand, Output (a) lacks clarity in its questions and sentence usage.
