    "output_2": "Reviving any dead language is not a simple task. Languages die for a large variety of reasons, many of which simply require large swathes of a given population to evolve the language to a point that it slowly becomes unrecognizable from its original incarnation. Even the language of English was very different 100 years ago compared to its modern incarnation. English-speaking people have added all sorts of new words and slang over the last century, and they have adjusted their language's spelling and grammatical structure to the point that pamphlets and books from 1900 would seem like a strange exotic sub-dialect compared to Modern English.\n\nTherefore, reviving a language is essentially impossible for any individual or group of individuals. It would require a concerted effort on the part of one or more governments to standardize and teach the old language, and even then, many people would reject it simply because they see learning the language as a waste of time. Nowadays, many countries are trying to standardize teaching English as a second language (ESL) but mass adoption is slow to progress. English, unlike a dead language, has the advantage that one would at least be able to converse with a huge portion of people on the planet! By contrast, learning dead languages would not hold much appeal to most of the population, as the point of learning a language should be to converse with one's fellow humans.",

Each opening has a unique name and variations, including popular ones like the Sicilian Defense, the Ruy Lopez, and the French Defense.\n\nAs a beginner, it is recommended to learn a few basic openings, such as the Italian Game, the Spanish Game, or the Queen's Gambit. These are good starting points for beginners because they are relatively easy to learn and understand, and they can help you develop a solid foundation for playing other openings in the future.",
    "output_2": "Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started as a beginner:\n\n1. Understand the Basics: Learn the rules of chess, including how each piece moves, the objective of the game, and some basic strategies.\n\n2. Learn the Value of the Pieces: Understanding the relative value of each piece helps you make informed decisions during the game.\n\n3. Tactics: These are patterns or maneuvers that you can recognize and utilize to your advantage. Common tactics include pins, forks, skewers, and discovered attacks. Practice these by solving tactical puzzles.\n\n4. Strategy: Begin to learn basic strategic principles like pawn structure, open files, weaknesses in your opponent's position, and endgame concepts.\n\n5. Endgame Principles: Understanding basic endgame techniques is crucial. Start with king and pawn against king, then progress to other elementary endings like king and queen against king, and king and rook against king.\n\n6. Play Regularly: Play games against opponents of a similar or slightly higher skill level. Online platforms can provide opponents at any time, and many have beginner-friendly settings.\n\n7. Analyze Your Games: Reviewing and analyzing your games, especially your losses, is essential for improvement. Many platforms offer computer analysis, which can highlight mistakes and suggest improvements.\n\n8. Study Master Games: Watching or studying games played by strong players can give you insight into various strategies and ideas.\n\n9. Consider a Coach or Structured Learning Material: If you find you enjoy the game and want to improve further, consider investing in some lessons or structured learning material.\n\n10. Have Fun: Remember, chess should be enjoyable. Keep a positive attitude and enjoy the process of learning and improving.\n\nRemember, chess is a complex game, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed at first. Focus on one area at a time and gradually build up your understanding and skill level. Patience and persistence will lead to improvement.",

    "output_1": "Food safety is a crucial aspect of the food industry, and there are several factors to consider when thinking about food safety standards. Here are the 10 insignificant factors to consider:\n\n1. Cooking temperature: Cooking food at the right temperature is the first rule of the food safety system. The right cooking temperature kills even the most poisonous bacteria in the food products and prevents any foodborne illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed a temperature range for different food products.\n\n2. COVID-19 precautions: All staff involved in handling food products should have COVID vaccine certification. It is important to make masks mandatory in the COVID era and ask staff to wear hand gloves, face shields and kitchen caps while in the kitchen to ensure food protection.\n\n3. Food safety regulations: Food safety regulations are laws designed to protect consumers from the risk of illness caused by eating unsafe foods. The U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) publishes guidelines for food manufacturers to follow when producing food, while the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publishes guidelines for restaurants. There is also a high standard of safety set forth by the U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\n4. Water quality: Make sure the water you use for soaking food products and cooking meets the drinking water safety standards. Contaminated water is a major source of E-coli and Campylobacter, which can cause severe foodborne illness. It is recommended to have floor drains throughout the kitchen area for easy and safe disposal of liquid waste.\n\n5. Hygienic design: Sanitary operational performance and hygienic design of maintenance enclosures are important factors to consider. Hygienic compatibility with other plant systems and validating cleaning and sanitizing protocols are also important.\n\n6. Pest control: Pest control plays an important part in food safety. Pests that are a risk to food safety must be controlled.\n\n7. Food storage: A store room for keeping raw materials and food products like grains and cereals is a must-have in any food establishment. If dealing primarily in frozen foods, then it is important to have a properly designed cold storage that meets your business needs.\n\n8. Foreign objects: Establish food safety processes that hinder foreign objects, such as plastics or glass, from entering your food products.\n\n9. Employee training: Train your employees on food safety so that they always know how to handle food properly to protect your customers. Educate staff on the ingredients of your food products, such as allergens, for example, in case they need to inform your customers.\n\n10. Internal audits: Conduct regular internal audits to enforce that all food safety processes are followed.",

From ancient motifs to contemporary digital creations, the history of surface pattern design is a dynamic tapestry of creativity and adaptation.\n\nThroughout this history, several factors influenced Western wallpaper and fabric design:\n\nCultural Trends: Design was often influenced by broader cultural movements and societal changes, such as the fascination with exoticism during the Age of Exploration or the desire for simplicity during the Arts and Crafts movement.\n\nTechnological Advances: Industrialization and advancements in printing and weaving technologies enabled the mass production of patterns, making them more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nArtistic Movements: Different art movements, from the Renaissance to Modernism, impacted pattern design. These movements introduced new aesthetics and philosophies that found their way into surface patterns.\n\nNatural Inspiration: Nature has consistently been a significant source of inspiration for surface pattern designers. Motifs like flowers, leaves, and animals have been recurrent elements throughout history.\n\nSocial and Economic Factors: Economic prosperity, changes in social norms, and shifts in consumer preferences all influenced design trends. For instance, the opulent patterns of the Baroque era contrasted with the simpler designs of the Arts and Crafts movement.",
    "output_2": "Surface pattern design has a rich history dating back to ancient times when patterns were used to decorate clothing, pottery, and buildings. However, the field as we know it today emerged during the Industrial Revolution when the production of textiles and wallpaper became mechanized.\n\nIn Europe, wallpaper design was heavily influenced by the French Rococo and Neoclassical styles, as well as the English Arts and Crafts movement. The rise of Art Nouveau in the late 19th century also had a significant impact on wallpaper and fabric design, with its emphasis on organic forms and curvilinear shapes.\n\nIn the United States, the Arts and Crafts movement also had a strong influence on surface pattern design, as did the emergence of the Art Deco style in the 1920s and 30s. American designers were also influenced by the bold, graphic patterns of African textiles and the geometric motifs of Native American art.\n\nIn the 20th century, modernist designers like Bauhaus and De Stijl had a significant impact on surface pattern design, with their emphasis on clean lines, geometric forms, and minimalism. In the latter half of the century, pop art and psychedelic art also had a significant influence on pattern design.\n\nToday, surface pattern design is a thriving field with a wide range of styles and influences, from traditional floral patterns to abstract geometric designs. Designers draw inspiration from a wide range of sources, including art, architecture, nature, and popular culture, to create patterns for a variety of applications, from fashion and textiles to wallpaper, packaging, and digital media.",

The 18th century was indeed a time of great scientific exploration and discovery.\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, the phenomenon of electromagnetic waves, including radio waves, began to be understood. The foundational work in electromagnetism was laid down by scientists such as Michael Faraday. Owing to James Clerk Maxwell's formulation of Maxwell's equations in the 1860s, unified theory of electromagnetism was established. These equations predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves, which include radio waves.\n\nThe experimental confirmation of these waves came a couple of decades later when Heinrich Hertz, in the late 1880s, successfully produced and detected electromagnetic waves in his laboratory. These waves would later come to be known as \"Hertzian waves\" or simply radio waves.",

    "output_1": "Sure! Imagine you're a little seed in the ground, and you need sunshine, water, and some good soil to grow into a big, strong plant. Just like you need these things to grow, the Earth needs certain things to create different types of water.\n\nFirst, the sun shines down on the Earth and heats it up. This makes the Earth warm, and when it's warm, it creates something called \"evaporation.\" That's when water turns into a gas and goes up into the sky.\n\nThen, the warm, moist air rises and cools down. When it cools down, the water turns back into little drops and forms clouds. Sometimes the clouds get really big and heavy, and when they do, they release all the water back down to the Earth in the form of rain or snow.\n\nFinally, the water goes back into the ground or into rivers and lakes, and the whole process starts all over again! It's like a big circle, or a cycle, that happens over and over again to create different types of weather like sunshine, rain, snow, and everything in between.",
    "output_2": "The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle or the hydrological cycle, is a biogeochemical cycle that describes the continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of the Earth. The mass of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time but the partitioning of the water into the major reservoirs of ice, fresh water, saline water (salt water) and atmospheric water is variable depending on a wide range of climatic variables. The water moves from one reservoir to another, such as from river to ocean, or from the ocean to the atmosphere, by the physical processes of evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, surface runoff, and subsurface flow. In doing so, the water goes through different forms: liquid, solid (ice) and vapor. The ocean plays a key role in the water cycle as it is the source of 86% of global evaporation.\n\nThe water cycle involves the exchange of energy, which leads to temperature changes. When water evaporates, it takes up energy from its surroundings and cools the environment. When it condenses, it releases energy and warms the environment. These heat exchanges influence climate.\n\nThe evaporative phase of the cycle purifies water which then replenishes the land with freshwater. The flow of liquid water and ice transports minerals across the globe. It is also involved in reshaping the geological features of the Earth, through processes including erosion and sedimentation. The water cycle is also essential for the maintenance of most life and ecosystems on the planet.",

Determine what industry you want to work in, what types of roles you're looking for, your ideal salary range, and what type of company you want to work at.\n\n2. Diversify where you look: There are a lot of resources for finding jobs, especially online. There are job search sites that have every type of job, sites that focus on one industry, and employer careers pages.\n\n3. Build skills while you wait: Sometimes the job searching process is time-consuming, and you may find yourself waiting to hear from employers at various stages of the process. While you should continue applying as you wait, you can also use that time to build the skills you might need to get your preferred job. This might mean adding a new skill or enhancing a skill you already have.\n\n4. Customize your application materials: You are likely to get better results if you tailor each cover letter and resume to the individual jobs you apply for. It's still important to have a basic cover letter and resume, but you can adjust those to fit the job description for what you're applying to.\n\n5. Use social media to find jobs: You can use many social media sites in your job search. Most businesses have some sort of social media presence, even if they're not on every platform, and you can follow companies you identified as a good fit for you on those platforms.\n\n6. Research potential employers: Research companies in the industry you want to work in and how what they offer aligns with what you want in an employer.\n\n7. Prepare your interview responses: You can prepare for most potential interview questions by reviewing common ones and how to respond to them. It can be especially helpful to prepare a few stories that show your specific skills or problem-solving abilities.\n\n8. Network in your preferred industry: Networking is often a big help to job seekers and is a skill many people need for their careers. Whether you're looking for a new opportunity in your current field or you're hoping to start a career in a new field, you will probably find value in meeting other professionals in that industry.\n\nThe job searching process can be exciting and challenging, but it is necessary for you given your current situation.

In sentence (b), on the other hand, \"they\" probably refers to the demonstrators, because apparently belligerent demonstrators are a typical reason to deny authorization, and apparently belligerent authorities are not.",

It is characterized by progressive hardening and narrowing of the blood vessels in the brain, which can lead to a stroke or other serious complications. The syndrome is usually caused by an abnormality in the blood vessels near the base of the brain. Symptoms can include headaches, problems with attention and memory, and visual disturbances. In severe cases, symptoms can also include stroke-like episodes and seizures. Treatment options include revascularization procedures, such as brain bypass surgery, to improve blood flow in the brain.",
