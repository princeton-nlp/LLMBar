    "output_2": "The idea of Bushid, \"the way of the warrior\", and its connection to chivalry, honor, etc., that is popping up in the answers to this question seems flawed.  Bushid is a relatively modern concept centuries removed from when samurai were actually involved in wars.  Bushido became a widely accepted idea in the Japanese national consciousness when a Japanese Quaker, with no background in history,named Inaz Nitobe wrote *Bushido: The Soul of Japan* (1899).  If you read the introduction it becomes apparent that he wrote the book out of a sense of inferiority to Western society and hoped to create an idea of something inherently Japanese that is of equal standing with the west.  He writes \"I have tried to illustrate whatever points I have made with parallel examples from European history and literature.\"  He then proceeds to create Bushid by choosing stories without any historical veracity or analysis of the historical context of these stories.  He then frames these stories in terms of Western philosophy and history.   You can see how flawed Inaz understanding of the history of the samurai is throughout the whole work.  One of my favorite chapters is \"The Sword the Soul of the Samurai\" in which he declares \"When Mahomet proclaimed that \"the sword is the key of Heaven and of Hell.\" he only echoed a Japanese sentiment.\"  Of course the problem with this is that the idea of the sword being the main weapon of the samurai only came about after the samurai had ended their wars and entered an era of relative peace during the 16th century.  When samurai basically became bureaucrats they increasingly focused on idealizing the symbol of their power, the sword that they alone were allowed to carry.  If you look at the first codes that Tokugawa laid down about samurai and the aristocracy, there is no mention of focusing on swords.  In fact, it mentions horse riding and archery as being important parts of being a samurai.",

I hope I am not overreacting if I think that it is dangerous, mainly because the drowning risk\u2026 Anyway, I realized that even if I gave her some big brother drinking advice (things like \u00ab if you don't feel like drinking because suddenly, the taste of alcohol kinda disgust you, it is time to stop, no matter what your friends tell you to do, you will not have a good time if you continue \u00bb), I never mentioned certain situations (like drowning while drunk).\n\nIn particular, It made me realize that I never told her something like \u00ab dudes flirting with you while drunk sometimes misinterpret your signals (by clumsiness or malignancy) and bad things can happen to you, so do not get too drunk with people you barely know/trust to be able to react well if it happens \u00bb. I want to tell her that and I want to make her understand that it is serious, but something I've understood by reading feminists books/articles is that many women live in a constant (and horrifying) fear of rape, and when some asshole rapes a woman, this woman often feels some guilt, feeling that it's her fault, that she should have been less clumsy, put on less sexy clothes, drunk less, etc.\n\nI do not my sister to feel that way, and moreover, I do not want to be a part of the transmission of this rape culture which blames victims!

Or eggs & sugar, depending on the recipe.  4 to 8 minutes depending on the recipes (ex. chocolate-chip cookies, brownies, etc.) 4. Not only using parchment paper, but PRE-CUT parchment paper!  Of all of the luxuries I've been able to enjoy over the years in my kitchen, this one is my faaaaaaavorite lol 5. Adopting a structured approach to baking.  I'm very much a mood-driven person; adopting a really simple structured approach helped me bottle that creative drive & turn it into engaging in baking more often.  I basically just plan things out one week ahead at a time & make sure I have all of the ingredients and set smartphone reminders to remind me to bake.  That way I have everything ready to go, which makes engaging in baking sooooo much easier due to preparation & convenience than waiting for the mood to strike! 6. Danish dough whisk.  Basically a 2D whisk.  Fantastic for batters & doughs!  I have a regular large one for most stuff plus a small one for things like oatmeal with mix-ins.  Also really good for mixing in frozen chocolate-chips so you don't get streaks! 7. Bi-material spatula-spoon.  This will be buried with me, I kid you not.  Picture this: Kitchenaid mixer bowl, two hands, one magic spoon for pulling the battery out & then scraping the sides clean! 8. SideSwipe blade for my Kitchenaid.  It scrapes the sides & the bottom so I don't have to!  Also pushes the ingredients down & supposedly mixes a lot faster than a regular flat paddle blade. Plus no oxidation! 9. Creating a visual \"look book\" for my family's favorite recipes.  Literally just a 3-ring binder with those clear paper sleeves - physical, simple, easy to use!  I have color-printed photos of stuff like this in there to inspire me!  I also use Pinterest quite a bit, as well as the Pinterest plugin for Google Chrome to capture things to put into boards. 10. The no-knead bread technique.  I make fresh bread & bready products all the time with this technique now!  Bread, baguettes, dinner rolls, cinnamon rolls, giant soft pretzels, bagels, English muffins, etc.!  Hugely, incredibly under-rated.  The ease at which you can bake every day if you want to is criminal!  They say a man's home should be his castle; I feel like your kitchen should be a mental vacation spot, where your tools & your setup work to support you in doing enjoyable things, rather than being a chore!  Having great tools, great ideas to work off, and a simple structured approach really goes a long way to making it fun & easy to engage in baking on a regular basis!",

    "output_1": " Great question!  There are several ways you can do this, if you\u2019re looking to make the outside of your car rustproof.  One option is to apply a protective coating.  This can be a transparent finish such as wax, or it could be a paint with a metallic pigment added in, which is basically a paint which appears metallic when seen from a distance.  If you want something that is both transparent and very protective against rust, you might want to look at a conversion varnish.  It has a surface like that of paint, but acts chemically to give your car a thick protective coating.  Another option is a finish called polyester car paint, which is a factory-applied finish that also does a good job of preventing rust.  It has some of the appearance of paint, but is not actually paint.  Another option is to paint your car with something called polymer paint, which is a very high-quality surface coating that can protect against the salt water for an extremely long time.",
    "output_2": " There are several ways you could coat your vehicle, you could use different methods based on what the vehicle needs to withstand.  The different methods have different advantages and disadvantages, let me give you an example.  You might choose to use a \u201croll on\u201d paint, which is a coating that sticks to the vehicle by physical adhesion.  In this case, the solution would be sprayed on the car, then when dry, would be washed off using another process.  The advantages are that this method is inexpensive and easily applied to a variety of vehicles.  The disadvantage is that over time the paint will flake off and become less effective.  There are also \u201c2-part paints\u201d, in this case, you would spray the paint and allow it to dry, then you would apply a solvent to finish the process and achieve a harder, stronger finish.  \nAlternatively, you could also use a \u201c3-part\u201d paint.  In this case, a primer is first applied to the surface, then an undercoat, and finally the color coat is applied.  The advantage of this is that it can provide a thicker coat of paint than just a single coat, giving it more protection.  The disadvantage is that it takes longer to apply.",

    "output_1": "There are a variety of reasons why more manual cars are sold in some countries, and why some people still prefer them over automatic cars, despite the higher cost and lower availability of manual cars in the US. In some countries, especially in Europe, automatic cars are considered a luxury because they are costlier to buy and maintain [4]. Europeans also tend to live in smaller towns and cities, making frequent stops, so stopping and starting again is commonplace and an automatic transmission is easier to operate [2]. In other countries, such as Japan, manual transmission cars are the norm because they are considered more reliable and are better suited for driving in narrow, crowded streets and hilly areas [5].",
    "output_2": "Manual cars are still popular on sporty vehicles and heavy-duty trucks. However, 90% of new vehicles are sold with automatic transmissions. [1] Manual transmissions are popular because they give a driver more control over how the engine works and how much power gets to the wheels. This is due to direct gear selection and torque transfer regulation. Manual transmissions are also durable and have less chance of failure than automatic transmissions. The worst case is that you may need to buy a clutch, which is usually inexpensive. [2, 3] Since a manual transmission has fewer mechanical parts, it's also smaller and more compact than an automatic transmission, making it advantageous for use in city centers and tight spaces.

    "output_1": "A lot of great answers, thanks for your time guys ^^",
    "output_2": "The idea of communism is a world where the means of production (the things people use to make goods) are owned socially. This means that everyone gets to benefit from them instead of an elite class called the bourgeoisie (the capitalists). Communists hold that there are two main classes in society, the proletariat who are the workers, the people who labor to make, design and distribute goods, and the bourgeoisie who own the means by which the proletariat does this.\n\n Because as a group the bourgeoisie has a monopoly on the means of production they hire proletarians to work for a wage. The labor of these proletarians, applied to the capital (wealth as expressed by the means of production) of the bourgeoisie which then creates value. In order to make a profit, the bourgeoisie does not pay the workers the full value of their labor, in fact, their goal is to screw the workers out of as much value as possible. The workers in turn want as much of their rightful wealth as they can get. So the workers form unions and the capitalists hire goons to murder them or politicians to write laws fucking the workers over. This is what is called class struggle. Communists believe that this system is bad and that the toilers, the proletariat, should control society not the capitalists. \n\nNow there are many sub theories of communism the three main branches of which are:\n\n*Marxism: A scientific approach towards understanding capitalism which deals with objective material conditions. This branch is further subdivided into countless sects with extremely divergent views on many issues. In fact its safe to say that some groups have almost nothing in common except the core writings of Karl Marx. That said, all Marxists agree that during the transition to a stateless, classless society (higher communism) the proletariat will need to seize state power and suppress the bourgeoisie. \n\n*Anarchism: This approach maintains that it is the state which is the source of society's woes. Anarchists believe that any state, even one controlled by the working class, is illegitimate. However, they also hold that capitalism and any hierarchical form of social relations are illegitimate. Anarchists seek to immediately dismantle the state and capitalist relations without a transitional phase. However, not all anarchists are communists there are mutualists and egoist anarchists as well. \"Anarcho-capitalists\" are not anarchists though since they do not oppose all hierarchy. \n\n*Finally, the last variety are Utopian Socialists. This is more of a historical branch but remnants can be seen in religious groups like the Mennonites. Notable groups include the Owanites and Saint-Simonites. \n\n\n\nNow Fascism on the other hand is an ideology based around national unity rather than class conflict. Fascists believe that classes have no natural antagonism and that the nation should be run in either a *corporatist* (this means the state manages all aspects and organizations of society but they maintain some autonomy. This is a feature of the system of the People's Republic of China) or *Totalitarian* (which means the state is directly in control of every aspect of society). Fascists believe a strong state is best for the glory of the nation and that the glory of the nation is more important than any one individual. Fascism really isn't a unified ideology like Marxism however.\n\n The Nazis, Francoists, Peronists, Iron Guard and Italian Fascists all had extremely different policies and social systems. Generally though fascism is highly moralistic, paternalistic and has the same sort of mythologized past as traditional conservatives. However, fascists also reject many aspects of contemporary society and loath liberalism, democracy and other bourgeois ideas. Fascists attack the status quo from the opposite direction from the communists. They advocate extreme hierarchical relations and have no problem with exploitation.  Fascism is best described as when the right-wing takes the tactics of the left (vanguard party, state planning ect) for the opposite cause. It is revolutionary reaction. \n\nSo essentially, communists are progressive, they want to push society in an egalitarian, positive, direction and most (but not all) are willing to use the state and violence as a means to get there, while fascists are reactionary, they want to push society backwards but use many of the same tactics to get there. The tactics themselves are the exact same ones the bourgeoisie used to seize power like in the French and American Revolutions. ",

[2] It is also possible that birds use language to communicate with each other in a non-verbal way, much in the same way that humans use body language to communicate. [4] In one experiment, a group of parrots from one Costa Rican flock was transplanted to a more northerly flock that showed different vocalization patterns. About half flew right back home, but the rest stayed and formed a sort of immigrant enclave with its own dialect. One even learned the northern tongue and ingratiated itself with locals. [3]  Moreover, birds seem to prefer calls that are familiar to their own and ostracize individuals that don't speak their language.

Philosophically speaking I'm more inclined to think that conservation of mass and energy is the most fundamental thing. This is pretty useless from a practical point of view, because all theories MUST have some axioms to boil down to in the end.

    "output_1": "I'm in a bit of a rush right now so sorry for an overly brief answer. This question deserves a veritable essay.\n\nThere's *loads* of ways of interpreting the *Iliad* along the lines you mention. There's no evidence for many of the *specific* symbolisms you suggest, though; Helen was sort of iconic of adultery, but the others not so much.\n\nThere's no doubt that, as a poem of its own time, the *Iliad* dissects the relationship between hero and community and does so pretty exhaustively and ruthlessly (Achilleus isn't spared much). In the Classical period this interpretation was still in vogue, but Sophokles' plays in particular go about hammering the point home still more. In his *Aias*, for example, Aias stands for what has been called \"the heroic temper\" against the democratic and demagogic tendencies of his community (represented by Menelaos and Odysseus, in very different ways). In that play (and in some other plays like the *Oedipus*) Sophokles broadcasts a message that there's something *inherently destructive* about great heroism.\n\nThis is a message that is also in the *Iliad*, though less explicitly: a large part of the problem in the *Iliad* is: how do you deal with having someone like Achilleus in your midst? He merits special treatment, of course, like any hero; but does he merit the *special special* treatment that he demands in book 9? When the embassy goes to visit him, they're expecting that he'll take compensation for Agamemnon's insult, because *that's how things work*: if there were a heroic code, one of the first rules would surely be \"when a wrong is done, payment is exacted\". When he refuses, they're stunned with incomprehension, because *he's not playing the part* that they'd expect of themselves.\n\nNow, to get back to the question you actually asked: I'd suggest taking a look, if you have time, at Stanford's book *The Ulysses Theme* (1958, I think) which covers the reception and interpretation of Odysseus throughout Greco-Roman antiquity and into the modern period. He draws out nicely the changing interpretations of his cunning. By the time Vergil got to him, Odysseus was an icon of deception and villainy; in the tragedies of the fifth century BCE, by contrast, he could still be *either* a villainous cad *or* an icon of wisdom, because that's how philosophers of the time were seen. Helen also had some interpretations dedicated to her, like Gorgias' *Encomium of Helen*, which tries to show -- subversively! -- that she was *not* an adulterous villainess.",
    "output_2": "One thing to think about while you consider this is that the way that ancient Greeks did not read the Iliad, but rather listened to trained singers reciting the poem. This means that it was usually listened to in a community fashion, and that it was not listened to in consecutive order. Singers could choose which parts of the story to highlight, and with what emotional emphasis to perform. Homer was considered the greatest poet by the Greeks, and the Iliad and the Odyssey informed and provided a basis for all later writers (who explored the stories in widely varying ways). My own thinking is that you cannot simply the Iliad to a single theme or group of themes; it is the culmination, or rather the gathering-up, of many of the myths of Homer's time.",

STEM = Science Technology Engineering Math  I will absolutely agree that: (1) Engineering and Technology, (2) Health Care (sub sector of Science) and (3) Statistics/Data Science (subsector ofMath..?) are in high demand and are usually well paid. Going into any of these specific fields directly is healthy.   HOWEVER basic scientists like biologists and chemists are not paid all that great and are certainly not in demand. Its not quite as bad as being a Art History major but I see many similarities on these Reddit threads between science grad students and humanities grad students.

Meanwhile their business and engineering counterparts start out at $80k with a just B.S.   Ok. So what? Why is this a problem? Well because many naive students believe their hard work, years of late night studying, 45 page thesis, lab work, etc. in life sciences will translate to a good paying job easily. I mean it is STEM right? But thats just not the case.

Death penalty convictions cost exorbitantly more than convictions resulting in life with out parole. This is almost almost always constant in every jurisdiction and every case that uses the death penalty as a form of punishment in the United States. The high cost associated with special trials, special provisions for death row prisoners as well as expensive drugs puts excessive strain on a criminal justice system that is already plagued with financial mismanagement. In addition to the cost, the USA often makes mistakes in death penalty cases. Some studies estimate up to 4% of individuals put to death were not guilty of the crimes they were convicted of. The irreversible nature of death means that there is no way for the justice system to right its wrongs should an innocent person be executed. The final reason that lethal injection is not preferable is the fact that it is not a deterrent for crimes. There is no evidence pointing to a decrease in high crime associated with the institution of capital punishment. Because of its cost, irreversibility, and, lack of effectiveness as a deterrent, lethal injection is less favorable than life without parole.  edit-grammar",

This may mean that what we perceive to be biological reality could in fact be computer code. [2] Some have pointed to our universe's laws of physics as possible evidence that we live in a video game. For example, the speed of light represents the speed limit for transmitting information within the network of our simulation. [3] Moreover, Earth exists within what astrobiologists call a Goldilocks Zone, close enough to a star that greenhouse gases can trap heat to keep liquid water, but far enough away that the planet does not become a Venusian hothouse. That we live in such an orbital sweet spot is circumstantial evidence that our sim-designers wanted us to succeed. [4] Finally, paranormal events are glitches in the simulation. [5]",

In his research, James Gates, a theoretical physicist at the University of Maryland, discovered that he was driven to error-correcting codes, which are what make browsers work, in his study of quarks and electrons and supersymmetry [2].

When you look into the spoon, rays of light bounce around the bowl, then pass through a focus point between your face and the centre of the spoon [1]. The reflection of rays from the upper part of your face are reflected downward, while those from the lower part are reflected upward [1]. This is the same for left and right: the left side reflects to the right and the right reflects to the left [2]. Because of this way of reflecting, the things on the bottom are shown at the top and vice versa [2].",
    "output_2": "A spoon is concave, meaning it goes inwards [3]. When you look into the concave part of the spoon, you see yourself upside down [1, 3]. The reason is that the curved surface of the bowl bounces incoming rays back towards a central focus point lying between your face and the centre of the spoon\u2019s [1]. In passing through this point, rays from the upper part of your face are reflected downward, while those from the lower part are reflected upward [1].

    "output_1": "There are two main reasons for why Creamer makes spokes in your coffee. First, all dairy products contain proteins, including casein [1]. When milk is liquid, these proteins are stable and don't clump together [1]. When you add acid to the mix, the proteins break down and start attaching to each other, causing milk to curdle [1, 2]. Second, coffee and tea contain just enough acidity to tip the pH of milk to the point of curdling [3, 4]. The effect is most often seen in milk that is close to going sour or when adding milk to very hot coffee or tea, since the high temperature can coagulate casein [3, 4]. The increased acidity of the milk also causes it to taste sour [2, 3]. The protein molecules can stick together or coagulate into the clumps known as curds [2, 3]. The watery liquid that remains is called whey [2]. Creamer tends to leave small circles of curdled milk in your coffee because the proteins in the dairy products repel each other so they can distribute evenly through the liquid [2]. ",
    "output_2": "Coffee creamers are used to make coffee sweet and to weaken the strong taste of black coffee. [1] They are dairy-free powders or liquids that come in different varieties, such as sugar-free, fat-free, and flavored. [1] If you want to add a dash of sweetness to your drip coffee, pour over coffee, or even espresso, then creamer is the way to go. [1] Coffee creamer will also lighten up coffee, so it is ideal for those who do not enjoy their coffee black and are lactose intolerant. [1] However, milk will do a better job than creamer when it comes to flavor. Milk will be high in fat and protein, which will make the coffee taste smooth and sweet. [2] Creamer, on the other hand, will not hide the taste of the coffee as much. It will make the coffee less bitter, but it won't be to the same level as milk does. [2]",

They prefer to dismiss the term Tertiary and replace it with the term Paleogene [2].

The comparison wouldn't even be remotely close.\n\n*There's a pretty big push right now to make fiber optic transceivers cheap and efficient enough to use everywhere at every distance, though (because of their numerous advantages over copper), so I'm guessing any power efficiency wins that copper has in the shorter distances will be going away.  There are probably already more power efficient fiber setups out there than the 'average' ones I used for the comparison in that first paragraph.",

    "output_1": "People do grow out of their asthma. People are still unsure exactly why, but one idea is that as you get older, your airways get wider. And that's all asthma is - a narrowing of the airways making it hard to breathe. \n\nThere's a lot of things that cause it. Doing things that tire you out like exercise, cold air, pollution. It can be because irritants get in your lungs, or something triggers your body to defend itself when it doesn't really need to (we call this allergies). This makes your air passages tighten and grow small, like clenching a fist. And that makes it harder for air to get in and out, which you need to live.\n\nThat's why it's important for people with asthma to carry their medicine, which they puff in to their lungs. This tells the lungs to relax,  making the airways wider.",
    "output_2": "Asthmatic here. A simple explanation for asthma is a condition in which the airway to the lungs narrows and becomes clogged with a mucus that, if not treated, may completely close the airway and prevent the individual from breathing. Why does the mucus appear, you ask? Everybody's body can produce this mucus, and can do so if the lung becomes infected or the body thinks something is trying to attack the lungs. The mucus acts as a barrier to prevent further damage. However, with asthmatics, the lungs tend to glitch out and occasionally think that they're being attacked when actually, the asthmatic may just be exercising or whatnot. Because the lungs think something's wrong, this mucus will occur and cause the individual some discomfort, or as we say \"my asthma is acting up.\"\n\nWhen you hear someone say \"my asthma is acting up,\" they're probably referring to wheeziness, pressure on the chest, coughing, lung pain, or a shortness of breath. \n\nEverybody's asthma is triggered differently, but primary culprits are exercise, pollen, smog, stress, change in temperature, extreme temperatures, dry/humid weather, and so many more. What triggers one asthmatic's asthma to act up could not affect another asthmatic at all, so it really depends. \n\nOccasionally, people grow out of their asthma. This is usually the case in teenagers who had asthma in their childhood. Along with all the other changes that happen to their body during puberty, the asthma \"glitch\" can simply fade away.",

You should know because it effects the hook you put on the line. Are they feasting on leaches? If so that's what your hook should look like. Walleye eat a lot of leaches in the spring, and that \"pattern\" almost always works, but in the fall you can bonk them on the head with a leach and they won't care.\n\nHave you tuned your lures? A lot of lures, especially crankbaits only work at a certain speed, with a certain line. Often you can bend and mold it with a pair of pliers but you need to have a good presentation to catch fish with them. A lure running off center won't catch wish.\n\nHow good it your equipment? It might sound silly but there is a big difference between a rod you buy at Walmart, and something that costs $200. With the more expensive rod you can feel what's going on at the end of your line, which means you're not limited to the ultra aggressive ones that almost hook them selves, but you can catch the fish that want to feel the bait before they eat it.\n\nCan you, or are you willing to change? A lot of people, heck a lot of communities think that there is only one way to catch fish on their lake. Maybe worms and a jig head off Murry point. What about a slip bobber and minnows? Or a sinker rig? Or reverse trolling a bottom bouncer? ",

    "input": "Why have the planets in the solar system assumed relatively perfect circular orbits?\n\nMany other objects in the solar system have eccentric orbits. Dwarf planets like Pluto and Sedna, and comets all have very eccentric orbits. Asteroids can also have odd orbits. The planets supposedly formed when asteroids smashed into each other to create a large object in the violence of the early solar system. Yet now the planets have relatively circular orbits while other objects in the solar system maintain highly elliptical orbits that sometimes aren't even on the same plane. Why is that?",
    "output_1": "Planets in the solar system are round because of gravitational forces that gathered the material in space into clumps which then grew larger and larger to become the planets. The force of the collision of these pieces caused the newly forming planets to become hot and molten. The force of gravity, pulled this molten material inwards towards the planet's center into the shape of a sphere. Later, when the planets cooled, they stayed spherical. [1, 2, 3] Now, while all the planets are round, some are rounder than others, including Mercury, Venus, and Saturn. [1] It is also possible to set up a satellite so that it has a circular orbit (a circle is just an ellipse whose foci coincide). In this case, the ground speed would vary. The initial velocity of the satellite would have to be large or small to correspond to the circular or elliptical orbit, respectively. [3]",
    "output_2": "In the early solar system the planets formed from a rotating cloud of gas and dust which spun around a newly forming sun [2]. The sun's gravity keeps the planets in their orbits [2, 3]. Their orbits remain nearly circular because the time scale to complete chaos is much greater than the total lifespan of the sun [1]. Mercury and maybe Mars are the only exceptions [1]. It's also possible that the planets' orbits remain nearly circular because there is no other force in the solar system which can stop them [2].",

This includes people from countries such as China, India, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. [2] However, the Asian category is not a geographic category. As the Census Bureau points out, it includes people from different parts of the Asian continent as well as people who have immigrated from these regions. [2] In 1917, Congress created the \"Asiatic Barred Zone,\" and banned immigration from most Asian countries, with the exception of Japan and the Philippines. [3] This progressively widened to include more and more Asian countries, until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, when all Asian immigration was banned. [1]",
    "output_2": "Asians tend to be short in stature, but this may be at least in part due to nutrition [1]. Regarding physical characteristics, Asians are characterized by a flat nose, small eyes with an epicanthal fold, and darker skin [1, 2]. This fold of skin covers the inner corner of the eye, giving Asians a characteristic narrow, almond-shaped eye shape [2]. The absence of the epicanthal fold in American Indian populations suggests this characteristic evolved after the Bering connection to America was severed [2]. A mutation in a critical human gene as the source of several distinctive traits that make East Asians different from other races has been identified [3]. The traits - thicker hair shafts, more sweat glands, characteristically identified teeth, and smaller breasts - are the result of a gene mutation that occurred about 35,000 years ago [3]. The discovery explains a crucial juncture in the evolution of East Asians[3].",

    "output_1": "To find the real reason, we need to go back to the early 1980s.\n\nIBM wanted to make a home computer. They had a choice of operating systems, and eventually decided to go with Microsoft (that's a story by itself, but we'll stick with the relevant stuff for now).\n\nDuring the negotiations, though, Microsoft won a key concession. IBM used Microsoft's operating system, called PC DOS, on their computers. But they won the right to also supply their own version of the software, called MS DOS. This meant that, unlike every other computer manufacturer, IBM were shipping a computer where they didn't own the sole rights to the operating system.\n\nAside from the operating system, most of the other components of the IBM PC were available off the shelf. The only exception was the BIOS, but this turned out to be relatively easy to reverse-engineer, find out how it worked, and build something similar enough to be compatible.\n\nAnd so the \"IBM PC Compatible\" computer was born - a computer which was not made by IBM, but which would run all the same software as IBM computers. This resulted in a huge surge of software for IBM PC Compatible computers, which resulted in more of those computers being sold, and so more software was written, etc - it developed into a self-sustaining growth.\n\nAnd to get back to your original question, those IBM computers used Intel chips. And so IBM PC Compatible computers also used Intel chips. And almost every PC ever sold since then has been based on the same technology, or evolutions of the same technology.",
    "output_2": "Originally, Windows, Windows was written for x86 and all their apps were written for x86, switching processors would require changes to practically every application. It's not impossible (Microsoft did make Windows NT for PPC), but it's a cost they don't want to do unless they have to.\n\nProbably more relevant though, the modern architecture of modern processors means the processor doesn't matter that much if you want speed. The newer x86 CPUs use the instruction set as a kind of byte code, they don't directly execute it, but instead treat them as RISC instructions that get compiled into CISC instructions at a hardware level during execution (essentially means the instructions are not executed the way you ask the processor to execute them, it reorders and combines them). When a processor does that, that step can include conversions between the x86 spec, and how the processor actually does things so the instruction set has only a minor effect on performance. Therefore switching architectures doesn't make a whole lot of a difference. Today everything uses x86 on desktop and server because it's the fastest processor with the best overall performance.\n\nAs for ARM, it's popular for a different reason, it's sold as an IP licenses core for use by anyone really. What that means is anyone can make an ARM processor, just have to pay the ARM people a royalty fee. The benefit is people building a SoC, like what's used on a cell phone that need minimum power usage. ARM can be modified to have appropriate specs (cache size, speed, usb enabled, etc) by editing a config file. Then the GPU manufacturer can stick the processor inside the GPU, and build it as one processor. They don't need to buy a physical chip from the ARM people.",

The sperm count in 1973 was 99 million sperm per milliliter of semen, and in 2011, the number had dropped to 47 million per milliliter. [1]  Some scientists have been observing and debating the cause of the decline in sperm counts for decades. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, a number of studies suggested that sperm counts in men were on the decline, but these studies had been largely ignored or dismissed on the grounds that they had been subject to selection bias and/or the inclusion of data from men with fertility or testicular problems.

Others hypothesized that the increase in endocrine-disrupting substances in the environment could be a contributing factor [1]. Another factor that could be having an impact is the sun, since ambient radiation could drive sperm decline [1].

    "output_1": "Separating memory and behaviours and perceptions has probably put back peoples understanding of brain function.   If you think of reflexes as a whole where some input makes certain neutrons fire which go into the central nervous system to connect eventually with an out put - maybe like motor neuron firing.   Now consider that there are simple reflexes and we understand those 2 or 3 neuron ones pretty well. Some inputs go into the huge labyrinth of connections in the brain. It is here that complex interactions between millions of reflexes can alter output. The static connection total or connectome alone can process, resonate, separate certain inputs into perceptions, and use these to build simulations of existence and choice options for actions which I would think is what we perceive as subjective experience.   This process is as quick as neuronal firing. But the whole complex structure of interlinking resonances and pathways which can already inhibit or promote certain resonances and pathways can adapt the connections themselves to provide for long term easy access to certain modes. This is what many people refer to as longer term learning.   Memorising simply means being able to repeat in my opinion.

    "input": "Continue the given dialogue:\n\n\n\nHuman: What's the holy Koran's view of gay people?\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question.  The Koran contains passages that are sympathetic to the suffering of people who are homosexual.  However, it also many religious leaders to seek to exclude gay people from participation in Muslim communities by some declaring homosexuality to be forbidden or sinful.  There is also a great deal of debate among Muslims about how to apply religious principles about homosexuality, and many Muslims practice Islam while also supporting legal rights for gay people.  Despite this complex debate among Muslims, Islam does have a strong tradition of religious freedom and inclusion, including for gay people.\n\nHuman: How do Muslims compromise their modern progressive view of homosexuality with the Koran's criticisms of it?\n\nAssistant: For many Muslims, the Koran presents homosexuality as a morally suspect condition that is to be rejected.  But it also prescribes that there be many different interpretations of scripture.  So when it comes to homosexuality, some Muslims take the interpretation that it should be condemned, and others have suggested that the Koran could instead be read to mean that it should be tolerated.  How to resolve this disagreement is an important topic for debate in Muslim communities.\n\nHuman: Isn't one of the differences between the Koran and the bible is that the Koran is \"un-alterable\", and there aren't supposed to be many different interpretations?\n\nAssistant:",
    "output_1": " The Koran does contain passages that may be interpreted as indicating that it is unchanging and unalterable.  But other passages may also be interpreted as indicating that the Koran's message is a bit contingent, and that it was not meant to be interpreted in a one-size-fits-all manner.  In addition to this, there are several different ancient translations of the Koran that often conflict.  This suggests that there is a degree of flexibility built into the message of the Koran, which has been helpful to allow different interpretations to develop and persist.  Still, some Muslims emphasize the idea that the Koran is a \"divine revelation\" that is unchanging, and is only subject to human interpretation insofar that it is meant to be understood.  Muslims in general are inclined to believe the Koran has a largely fixed meaning, which remains relevant in all times and places, but there is also significant disagreement within Muslim communities about how to correctly understand the Koran.",
    "output_2": " The concept of there being only one true interpretation of scripture comes from a tradition of jurisprudence called \"ijtihad\" that was developed centuries after the Koran was written.  Ijtihad was used to provide a single, unchanging interpretation of Islamic law, but it is often criticized as being inconsistent with the Koran's commands to respect difference of opinion.",

    "output_1": "I often hear the claim that the pieces we consider classical music have \"stood the test of time\" and that what we listen to today from that period is most likely going to be the best of that period and not representative of the average piece, and would contribute to the association between classical music and intellectualism. Is there any merit to this argument?",
    "output_2": "As usual, the answer is complicated, but it's more simple than other complicated answers. The complication has to do with time period; when we say Classical music, it ranges hundreds of years that are categorized by styles that you mentioned, Baroque, Classical, and Romantic. While they are categorized by year (Baroque lasting from roughly 1600-1750, Classical from 1750-1800, and Romantic from 1800-1900, all being rough), they are different from each other. \n\nThe early Baroque is mainly funded by rich merchants but slowly spread across Europe till the style is widely diffused to all of Europe, famously ending with J.S. Bach. By the end of the Baroque era, music was being paid for (the royalty or rich being patrons of the musicians) by Royalty. A composer would either be paid to write a piece or dedicate it to a member of royalty. This would be the main method of music production (within the Classical genre as folk music still existed) until the early Romantic Era (first few decades of the 19th century).\n\nThe change came due to a rising middle class. In Vienna, there were a multitude of middle class workers that would play music for themselves.  The composer Franz Schubert best exemplifies it, often he would compose music for his friends and play it for them at parties they threw. From here, romantic composers would start to compose music for profit to the middle class; Antonin Dvorak wrote many String Quartets that were specifically written to sell.\n\nFast forward a few decades from Schubert and you'll find the Strauss family writing waltzes. These waltzes weren't for the nobility but for the public to dance to, which were of course sold so people may play them. If any single composer shows a non-intellectual interest, you might look at Strauss Jr. for composing dance music. ",

Perhaps the puppet is using some sort of string/ligament system instead, perhaps giving it the naturalistic movement, but then why can't a functional limb be built around this system? What limitations are preventing such a realistic looking arm (at least in terms of behaviour) and is anybody actively trying to overcome these limitations? ",
    "output_1": "Bionic arms and hands are impressive feats of engineering, but they are much simpler than natural hands [2]. Although they can perform a wide variety of tasks, they lack the dexterity of natural hands [2]. A key feature of bionic arms is that there is only one independent joint, the MCP joint (main knuckle) [1]. The other two joints automatically follow that joint's lead, producing a fixed pattern of motion [1]. However, researchers have solved part of the problem of smooth motor control by connecting an artificial limb to a different part of the brain [3]. The connections to the robotic arm were wired into a patient's posterior parietal cortex, which is located on the side of the head near the ear [3].",
    "output_2": "The human body is controlled by neural signals sent from the brain, sending electrical signals through the body to move muscles [1]. Prosthetic limbs are often constructed using myoelectric control, using the electrical activity naturally generated by contracting muscle tissue to move an artificial limb [2]. This control can be manipulated to move the joints in a way that mimics the natural motion of a limb, making the prosthetic limb feel like an extension of the human body [1]. There are two main reasons why bionic limbs appear to have stilted, unrealistic animations. The first is because they are controlled by electrical energy, which can be amplified, processed, and utilized to control the movement of a motor in an artificial limb [2]. The second reason is because the limbs are not connected to the skeleton, which limits the range of motion and activates mechanoreceptors that trigger sensations of stretching skin when the harness or suction that attaches the limb to the body is activated [4].",

He listens to all basic commands and makes good eye contact most of the time. He is quite defensive of the yard and property. If someone comes to the door or a loud car drives by he barks and growls. He quickly quiets down when you ask him to. (Most of the time except when he is in the yard alone) He gets along very well with other dogs and people.

I do alot of indoor training/play with him as well.\n\nThe other day my friends phone rang and he stood up about to answered it. At the same time my dog started growling and attacked him. He stopped after a few seconds (gave him sit commands etc) but was still very heated. My friend went in the other room for his phone call and it seemed like my dog wanted to follow him. We both thought the ringtone agitated him.\n\nAre there any clear cut training methods to stop this behavior? It happened twice now with two different people.

The difference between copyright and trademark is that the symbol  is used instead of  or  [5]. Copyrights protect the expression of an idea, and not the idea itself, whereas a trademark is a brand that distinguishes you from your competitors [5]. Unlike with copyright protection, to get patent protection one must first apply for and be granted a patent from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) [4]. The patent application process is expensive, complex, difficult, and time consuming and generally should not be attempted without the assistance of an experienced patent attorney or agent [4].",

It identifies a product as belonging to a specific company and recognizes the company's ownership of the brand [2].

A more handy definition is to think of a trademark as a brand name [4]. Like a brand name, the point of a trademark is to identify a specific product as coming from a specific source [4]. A copyright covers artistic and intellectual works like books, songs, plays, and computer software [5]. A patent protects inventions and the way an item is used (utility patent) or how it looks (design patent) [5].

There are several different ways that bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics, including restricting access to the drug, getting rid of the drug, changing or destroying the drug, and bypassing the drug's effects [1]. Often, a random mistake in the bacteria's DNA will create a gene that gives the bacteria resistance to antibiotics [3]. Every time a multiplication event happens, there is a chance that a mutation like this will occur, because bacteria multiply a lot [3]. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) is a strain of bacteria that is resistant to an antibiotic called vancomycin [4]. VRE has been around for over thirty years, and scientists have been able to group different strains of VRE according to how they defend themselves against vancomycin [4]. For two types of VRE, called VanA and VanB, the bacteria gained resistance when a mutation occurred in their DNA [4]. This mutation gave the bacteria an ability to fend off the vancomycin molecule [4].",

Changing number mode changes the calculator display, but any data stored in the calculator is retained [2]. Therefore you can convert between different number systems by entering data and then selecting the new number base [2]. However, only the decimal system has a decimal point, the other number bases work for integers only [2]. Also note that a number in one system will require a larger number of digits in a lower number base, which may cause an overflow [2]. This is especially likely when converting to binary [2].

    "input": "Is there any use taking Spirit Airlines to Small Claims Court? Hi,  My partner and I (and our 10 month old puppy) purchased round trip tickets through Spirit Airlines...  Direct flights from Milwaukee, WI to LAX to visit my family for the first time in two years due to the pandemic.  The night before our return trip, we got an email from Spirit saying that our flight was cancelled, and strangely, \"not to try to call or come to the airport\".  The news showed that Spirit had been dealing with this issue for 3 days at that time, with people stranded at the airport for 30 hours in some cases.   We called Spirit multiple times to try to find another flight.  At first, their phone lines would pick up and we'd hold for about an hour and then it would automatically hang up on us.  Eventually, their phone line stopped taking calls and had an automated message that said to use their online chat feature and then hung up on us.  We tried that, but it was unable to book flights with other carriers or offer hotel or food vouchers (the replacement flights Spirit originally offered us all ended up getting cancelled two days later).  I sent an email to Spirit's email complaint forms prior to our expected departure time, stating that we were stranded and sought to get a flight through another carrier, and never heard back from that.  I also went to the airport to extend our rental car and stood in line with Spirit for hours to no avail.  In short, we were stranded in LA with no way to get home and no way to get ahold of the airline we'd booked with and no budget for our extra stay.  We ended up finding the best deal we could find on a flight home through United two days later (flights the same day were over $1000/ticket) and just putting it on a credit card, hopeful that we could fight it out with Spirit if/when we could finally get in touch with them.   The cheapest we could find was $870.40 one-way for the two of us with our dog, two days later (and with a lay-over).  We extended our rental car, and booked the cheapest hotel we could find that would take our dog.  Not to mention, we had to feed ourselves for those days and miss work.  We arrived home late last night.  I've tried to call Spirit multiple times today with no luck.  I was on hold for nearly 30 mins just now and then was hung up on automatically.    Spirit's CEO keeps carefully phrasing his apologies to include things like \"weather\" which I imagine they'll hope to use to get out of their contract with passengers, however it seems clear that this issue had more to do with overbooking and under-staffing and their own operational issues as they've also apologized for publicly.  At this point, Spirit's poor management decisions cost us over $1700 just to get home from this trip (not including our food and loss of work).  Are there any legal avenues to get compensated by a company like Spirit in this situation?  Is small claims court an option?  Any help would be deeply appreciated, as these unexpected expenses all went on credit cards this week.  Thank you!",

    "output_1": "Denuvo uses anti-tampering DRM to protect games from being cracked [1, 5, 3]. It can license Denuvo and integrate it into their PC games [1]. If they do, the Denuvo software provides anti-piracy protection [1]. Its designed to make it more difficult for people to crack games and distribute them for free [1, 5]. According to Denuvo, it stops the reverse engineering and debugging required to crack a game [1]. Denuvo works by pre-emptively encrypting a software's instructions and then decrypting the instructions in real-time to execute on the CPU [2]. It downloads the rest of files, encrypts those files, and ties those files to your hardware, making it so only you can play that game on that specific hardware [2, 5]. When a new major update is released, or there is a change in hardware, Denuvo replaces those files and reties them to your current hardware [2]. Denuvo claims this has no perceptible effect on game performance nor is Denuvo to blame for any game crashes of genuine executables [4].",
    "output_2": "Denuvo DRM is integrated into the codebase of a game during development, so a programmer can rewrite or optimize the code without compromising its security [1]. Denuvo runs as a background process with its own PID or thread in the game, rather than as a single check at the start of the game, which would be easy to bypass [1]. Each time a game is launched, Denuvo's validation code gets inserted right into the middle of the code stream for every invocation instead of calling a function, making it difficult to bypass [1].

He is a reserved man and relationships have been hard for him in the past, not because he has commitment issues or anything, he could just not connect with the girls he was seeing. \n\nAnywho, we are now together in a healthy relationship and he is going to college in the same city i will be in highschool. I am a junior and plan on applying to a university in the same city. mostly because it is a prestigious university but the fact that he will be nearby is very nice as well.  If i get accepted, i would definitely attend for financial reasons even if it isn't necessarily my first choice. \n\nWe have talked over things vaguely and he says he would really like to stay with me in college.

    "output_1": "Plants near the equator have evolved to survive the extreme conditions of high UV light, intense heat and humidity, and long periods of wetness [2][3]. These conditions are poor for the survivability of many species, thus resulting in a greater variety of species in the tropics [2]. Also, the equator is climatically stable and has existed for a longer geological timescale than more northern or southern regions [1]. As a result, more evolutionary lineages have persisted until the present day [1].",
    "output_2": "Plant biomass is elevated at the equator due to climate factors. The climate is warm and wet, enabling photosynthesis to proceed at a high rate, allowing enzymes to work most efficiently, and allowing stomata to remain open without the risk of excessive transpiration [1]. As a result, the amount of carbon dioxide moving into the plant is maximal, resulting in high biomass production. In contrast, dry and cold environments have lower photosynthetic rates and therefore less biomass [1]. In addition, the distribution and abundance of plants are affected by inorganic nutrients, namely nitrogen and phosphorus, which plants obtain from the soil when water moves into the plant through the roots [2]. Soil structure (particle size of soil components), soil pH, and soil nutrient content play an important role in plant distribution and abundance [2].",

    "output_2": "It's not \"angular force,\" assuming that you mean torque.\n\nThere's a trick in physics and math called \"vector decomposition,\" which is what /u/briant1234 was talking about. Lots of things in physics are what we call *vectors*, which is a type of \"number\" that has both a direction and a magnitude (strength).\n\nVelocity, for example, is a vector. When you have a velocity, you have both a speed and a direction of travel (in physics, \"speed\" is just speed, whereas \"velocity\" has a direction as well).\n\nSo, let's say your velocity is 14 mph northeast. What we can do is \"decompose\" your velocity into north and east \"components.\" If you travel at 14 mph to the northeast, you're traveling 10 mph directly to the north and 10 mph directly to the east. This is what a decomposition is: it's breaking \"14 mph northeast\" into \"10 mph north and 10 mph east.\"\n\nWe can also apply decomposition to a force, which is what you're applying to the wagon to make it move. Specifically, we'll break it into a horizontal component and a vertical component.\n\nWhether you push or pull, the horizontal component of force is the same (assuming you can push just as hard as you can pull). It's always just forwards.\n\nHowever, if you pull, the *vertical* component of the force is generally upwards. In contrast, when you push, the vertical component is downwards. Since your goal is to clear an obstacle on the ground, you need to apply an upwards force to the wagon.\n\nThat's why pulling it is easier: you're helping the wagon clear the obstacle by pulling up as well as to the side. When you push, you're actually making it harder, because you're pushing it down into the obstruction.",

    "output_1": "Okay so picture the future as being down, the past being up. But you are a 2 dimensional being so up and down are not directions you can perceive, you can only perceive the cross section of that up and down axis that intersects with you. Now imagine falling as that 2 dimensional being, and as you are falling, completely oblivious that it is even happening at all, you pass a balloon. From the perspective of the 2D being a dot would appear, grow into a ring, expand, shrink back into a dot and phase out of existence over time. In much the same way as that 2d being was moving through the 3rd dimension, and so experiencing something changing over time from it's perspective, we are moving/falling through the 4th dimension. Instead of falling from up to down, we are falling from past to future and things appear, grow, shrink, and eventually seem to disappear in the same way as that balloon seemed to vanish for the 2D being even though it was still there just outside of it's perception.  Could we travel through time? We already are. Could we control the rate and direction we are moving through time? Maybe, but it will be extremely difficult to get our bearings. For instance point in the direction of the past right now. See my point?  I hope this explained things this is a really difficult concept to simplify",
    "output_2": "If you've ever drawn a distance-time graph then you've used time as a dimension. A dimension isn't fundamental to the fabric of the universe, it's just about describing movement. We can describe movement in three spacial dimensions normally, and also we can describe their movement through time. It mostly comes up in special relativity where one object might not be moving through time at the same rate as another. This isn't about time travel, it's about how someone travelling very close to the speed of light would perceive time as travelling slower.  And to be clear: time isn't *the* 4th dimension, it's *a* 4th dimension. When you see mathematicians talking about 4 dimensional shapes, the 4th dimension isn't time. It's a fourth dimension of space that we can't really understand visually but can still describe mathematically. 3 dimensions of space just means there's three directions you can move in, x y and z. Adding a fourth dimension means adding another possible direction. This can be time but doesn't have to be.",

    "input": "How can we ethically justify training graduate students? My background is in biomedical research, and I'm currently a research scientist, applying for TT positions. I've been struggling with the idea of training my own graduate students and for years now I've been reluctant to encourage undergraduates to continue on to grad school. Every time an undergraduate research assistant has expressed interest in pursuing a PhD, I've tried to explain to them the enormity of the deck stacked against them. To wit:  * Compared to other highly educated people in the general population, PhD students are about 2.5 times more likely to be at risk for depression and other psychiatric disorders.  About one in three end up with symptoms of a psychiatric disorder.   * For 80% of grad students, an academic career is the goal, but just over 10% actually achieve a faculty position. And those 10% are not equally distributed across institutions, but disproportionately come from elite institutions 1-3], the kinds of which I will most likely not be teaching at.  * [Most biomedical PhDs end up having to do a postdoc, but postdoc salaries are lower than that of a new college graduate even though the postdoc is working 50+ hours per week and is 9 years older than the new college grad.   * 20% of postdocs report having existential crises related to their careers.  * If the postdoc goes into industry, their salary (~$48K/yr )  is still less than the median new college grad (~50K/yr) AND it's unlikely the private sector biology PhD will be able to continue doing research 4-5]. Indeed, if the postdoc sticks with research, they can expect to be paid [less.   * Moreover, several studies agree that there isnt any evidence a postdoc will actually benefit seekers of non-academic jobs 6-8]. When comparing private sector workers 10 years post-PhD, the salary of those who went the postdoc route are [$12,000 lower than those who skipped postdocs altogether.   So if I encourage someone to go to grad school, I'm essentially putting them on a path toward some pretty dire consequences for their career, especially if they do a postdoc, which most will. If they're not getting paid well, they're not getting training that can help them thrive outside of academia, and they're miserable, how can I justify telling them to go this route?   I think I'm a pretty good mentor. I think my research is important. But I'm realistic about the prospects of my trainees. They're not all going to end up in tenured faculty positions, and the numbers concerning the alternatives are all pretty grim. I can try my best to make sure my students aren't stressed out horribly, but I can't do anything to ensure they'll have meaningful, fulfilling jobs in science that actually pay enough to make grad school worthwhile.   So how do you do it? How do we as mentors look our students in the eyes and tell them to ignore the statistics and persevere, hoping they'll be one of the few to buck the trends?

I really don't think that I would have done better in the private sector being someone who was bright, but didn't really know how professional fields work at all.

    "input": "why do hindu's believe in reincarnation?",
    "output_1": "I'm a Hindu atheist, so I don't actually believe in reincarnation, but this is how my parents explained the reason for this belief to me.\n\nThe ancient Hindu philosophers believed in karma. Karma is basically the ancient concept of justice. If you do good deeds, your life will be good, and if you sin, you will bear the consequences of it. But they observed that this was not always the case. They saw that many people who were righteous abd good had evil befall them, and many evildoers led long and happy lives. This was a basic flaw in their reasoning, that would have proved their belief false.\n\nChristians too had the same problem in their reasoning. They got around it by saying that God rewards their good deeds by keeping them in heaven or punishes their bad deeds by sending them to hell after death. The Hindu philosophers, on the other hand, explained this by saying that people who sinned would be reborn as lesser beings, or lead their next life in misery, while the good people would be rewarded with a happy next life. This was also used to explain why people who were good and righteous lead miserable lives- it was due to their sins in past lives!\n\nSo this meant that the soul was in a never ending cycle of rebirths. The only way to escape from this cycle was moksha. Souls could attain their original divine state and become one with the creator. This could be achieved by three ways- the pursuit of knowledge or enlightenment, doing good deeds and living increasingly rightoeus and honourable lives, and devotion to God.",
    "output_2": "Reincarnation \u2013 known as Punarjanma \u2013 it is one of the core beliefs of Hinduism that is generally accepted by many of its practitioners.\n\nReincarnation is the natural process of birth, death and rebirth. Hindus believe that the Jiva or Atman (soul) is intrinsically pure. However, because of the layers of I-ness and My-ness, the jiva goes through transmigration in the cycle of births and deaths. Death destroys the physical body, but not the jiva. The jiva is eternal. It takes on another bodywith respect to its karmas. Every karma produces a result which must be experienced either in this or some future life. As long as the jiva is enveloped in ignorance, it remains attached to material desires and subject to the cycles of births and deaths (Samsara).\n\n_URL_0_\n\nTL; DR if you give up material things and your ignorance, you escape the cycle of reincarnation. Until then, you will be reborn as something better or worse depending on how close you were.",
