For example, if a property owner knows about a hazardous condition on their property and does nothing to fix it, they may be liable for any injuries that result.\n\nIt's worth noting that the specifics of premises liability laws can vary from state to state, so the exact rules and regulations may differ depending on where you are.

Bushid is a relatively modern concept centuries removed from when samurai were actually involved in wars.  Bushido became a widely accepted idea in the Japanese national consciousness when a Japanese Quaker, with no background in history,named Inaz Nitobe wrote *Bushido: The Soul of Japan* (1899).  If you read the introduction it becomes apparent that he wrote the book out of a sense of inferiority to Western society and hoped to create an idea of something inherently Japanese that is of equal standing with the west.  He writes \"I have tried to illustrate whatever points I have made with parallel examples from European history and literature.\"  He then proceeds to create Bushid by choosing stories without any historical veracity or analysis of the historical context of these stories.  He then frames these stories in terms of Western philosophy and history.   You can see how flawed Inaz understanding of the history of the samurai is throughout the whole work.  One of my favorite chapters is \"The Sword the Soul of the Samurai\" in which he declares \"When Mahomet proclaimed that \"the sword is the key of Heaven and of Hell.\" he only echoed a Japanese sentiment.\"  Of course the problem with this is that the idea of the sword being the main weapon of the samurai only came about after the samurai had ended their wars and entered an era of relative peace during the 16th century.  When samurai basically became bureaucrats they increasingly focused on idealizing the symbol of their power, the sword that they alone were allowed to carry.  If you look at the first codes that Tokugawa laid down about samurai and the aristocracy, there is no mention of focusing on swords.  In fact, it mentions horse riding and archery as being important parts of being a samurai.",

However, it's important to note that the samurai class was not a monolith, and not all samurai were guilty of such actions.\n\nThere were instances where samurai were involved in banditry, extortion, and other forms of exploitation, particularly during times of social unrest or economic hardship. However, it's important to recognize that these actions were not representative of the entire samurai class, and many samurai were known for their honor, integrity, and adherence to a strict code of conduct known as bushido.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the character in the movie Seven Samurai who makes the accusation is a member of a marginalized group and has personal reasons for holding this belief. While the accusation may have some basis in reality, it's also motivated by personal grievances and may not be entirely objective.\n\nIn summary, while there may be some legitimacy to the accusation that some samurai engaged in harmful behaviors, it's important to recognize that the samurai class was diverse and complex, and not all samurai were guilty of such actions. It's also important to consider the context and motivations behind the accusation.",

Having great tools, great ideas to work off, and a simple structured approach really goes a long way to making it fun & easy to engage in baking on a regular basis!",

        "One tool that has greatly elevated my baking skills and confidence is a thermometer. Specifically, an instant-read thermometer that allows me to accurately measure the internal temperature of my baked goods. This tool has been a game-changer in ensuring that my baked goods are cooked to the perfect temperature, which is especially important when it comes to items like cakes, cookies, and breads.\n\nBefore using a thermometer, I would often rely on the \"toothpick test\" or \"tapping\" method to check for doneness. However, these methods can be unreliable and lead to over or under-baked goods. With a thermometer, I can quickly and easily check the internal temperature of my baked goods and know exactly when they are done to my desired level of doneness. This has helped me to achieve consistent results and has given me the confidence to experiment with new recipes and techniques.\n\nAnother benefit of using a thermometer is that it allows me to adjust my baking time and temperature accordingly. For example, if I'm baking a cake and the internal temperature is higher than expected, I can adjust the baking time accordingly to prevent overcooking. This has saved me from many potential disasters and has helped me to achieve perfect, consistent results.\n\nOverall, a thermometer is a simple yet powerful tool that has greatly elevated my baking skills and confidence. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their baking game!",

Some argued that the military should not be expected to carry out such orders, and that it was their duty to disobey them if they believed they were unethical or illegal.\n\nTo address these concerns, the military implemented various measures to ensure that nuclear missiles would be launched only when authorized and necessary. These measures included:\n\n1. Two-man rule: The silos were staffed by two personnel, who had to agree on the launch order before it could be carried out. This was intended to ensure that both personnel were convinced that the order was legitimate and necessary.\n2. Permissive Action Links (PALs): PALs were codes that had to be entered into the missile launch system before a launch could be authorized. These codes were known only to the President and a small group of authorized personnel, and they were changed regularly. This ensured that only authorized personnel could launch the missiles.\n3. Command and control protocols: The military established strict command and control protocols to ensure that launch orders were authenticated and verified. This included the use of secure communication channels and authentication codes.\n4.

This can be a transparent finish such as wax, or it could be a paint with a metallic pigment added in, which is basically a paint which appears metallic when seen from a distance.  If you want something that is both transparent and very protective against rust, you might want to look at a conversion varnish.  It has a surface like that of paint, but acts chemically to give your car a thick protective coating.  Another option is a finish called polyester car paint, which is a factory-applied finish that also does a good job of preventing rust.

Another option is to paint your car with something called polymer paint, which is a very high-quality surface coating that can protect against the salt water for an extremely long time.",

The different methods have different advantages and disadvantages, let me give you an example.  You might choose to use a \u201croll on\u201d paint, which is a coating that sticks to the vehicle by physical adhesion.  In this case, the solution would be sprayed on the car, then when dry, would be washed off using another process.  The advantages are that this method is inexpensive and easily applied to a variety of vehicles.  The disadvantage is that over time the paint will flake off and become less effective.  There are also \u201c2-part paints\u201d, in this case, you would spray the paint and allow it to dry, then you would apply a solvent to finish the process and achieve a harder, stronger finish.  \nAlternatively, you could also use a \u201c3-part\u201d paint.  In this case, a primer is first applied to the surface, then an undercoat, and finally the color coat is applied.  The advantage of this is that it can provide a thicker coat of paint than just a single coat, giving it more protection.  The disadvantage is that it takes longer to apply.",

Europeans also tend to live in smaller towns and cities, making frequent stops, so stopping and starting again is commonplace and an automatic transmission is easier to operate [2].

Fuel efficiency: Manual cars are generally more fuel-efficient than automatic cars, especially in city driving. This is because the engine is always engaged with the gears in a manual car, whereas an automatic car's engine can sometimes be in a higher gear than necessary, leading to wasted fuel.\n2. Cost: Manual cars are typically less expensive to purchase than automatic cars, and they can also be cheaper to maintain. This is because the transmission in a manual car is simpler and requires less maintenance than an automatic transmission.\n3. Control: Some drivers prefer the control and connection to the car that a manual transmission provides. With a manual car, the driver has to be more actively involved in the driving process, which can be a more engaging and enjoyable experience.\n4. Performance: Manual cars can offer better performance and acceleration than automatic cars, especially in certain driving situations. This is because the driver has more control over the gears and can shift them to suit the driving conditions.\n5. Personal preference: Some people simply prefer the feel and experience of driving a manual car. They may enjoy the physical act of shifting gears, the sound of the engine, or the sense of control that comes with a manual transmission.\n\nOverall, there are several practical and personal reasons why someone might prefer a manual car over an automatic car.",

    "output_2": "The idea of communism is a world where the means of production (the things people use to make goods) are owned socially. This means that everyone gets to benefit from them instead of an elite class called the bourgeoisie (the capitalists). Communists hold that there are two main classes in society, the proletariat who are the workers, the people who labor to make, design and distribute goods, and the bourgeoisie who own the means by which the proletariat does this.\n\n Because as a group the bourgeoisie has a monopoly on the means of production they hire proletarians to work for a wage. The labor of these proletarians, applied to the capital (wealth as expressed by the means of production) of the bourgeoisie which then creates value. In order to make a profit, the bourgeoisie does not pay the workers the full value of their labor, in fact, their goal is to screw the workers out of as much value as possible. The workers in turn want as much of their rightful wealth as they can get. So the workers form unions and the capitalists hire goons to murder them or politicians to write laws fucking the workers over. This is what is called class struggle. Communists believe that this system is bad and that the toilers, the proletariat, should control society not the capitalists. \n\nNow there are many sub theories of communism the three main branches of which are:\n\n*Marxism: A scientific approach towards understanding capitalism which deals with objective material conditions. This branch is further subdivided into countless sects with extremely divergent views on many issues. In fact its safe to say that some groups have almost nothing in common except the core writings of Karl Marx. That said, all Marxists agree that during the transition to a stateless, classless society (higher communism) the proletariat will need to seize state power and suppress the bourgeoisie. \n\n*Anarchism: This approach maintains that it is the state which is the source of society's woes. Anarchists believe that any state, even one controlled by the working class, is illegitimate. However, they also hold that capitalism and any hierarchical form of social relations are illegitimate. Anarchists seek to immediately dismantle the state and capitalist relations without a transitional phase. However, not all anarchists are communists there are mutualists and egoist anarchists as well. \"Anarcho-capitalists\" are not anarchists though since they do not oppose all hierarchy. \n\n*Finally, the last variety are Utopian Socialists. This is more of a historical branch but remnants can be seen in religious groups like the Mennonites. Notable groups include the Owanites and Saint-Simonites. \n\n\n\nNow Fascism on the other hand is an ideology based around national unity rather than class conflict. Fascists believe that classes have no natural antagonism and that the nation should be run in either a *corporatist* (this means the state manages all aspects and organizations of society but they maintain some autonomy. This is a feature of the system of the People's Republic of China) or *Totalitarian* (which means the state is directly in control of every aspect of society). Fascists believe a strong state is best for the glory of the nation and that the glory of the nation is more important than any one individual. Fascism really isn't a unified ideology like Marxism however.\n\n The Nazis, Francoists, Peronists, Iron Guard and Italian Fascists all had extremely different policies and social systems. Generally though fascism is highly moralistic, paternalistic and has the same sort of mythologized past as traditional conservatives. However, fascists also reject many aspects of contemporary society and loath liberalism, democracy and other bourgeois ideas. Fascists attack the status quo from the opposite direction from the communists. They advocate extreme hierarchical relations and have no problem with exploitation.  Fascism is best described as when the right-wing takes the tactics of the left (vanguard party, state planning ect) for the opposite cause. It is revolutionary reaction. \n\nSo essentially, communists are progressive, they want to push society in an egalitarian, positive, direction and most (but not all) are willing to use the state and violence as a means to get there, while fascists are reactionary, they want to push society backwards but use many of the same tactics to get there. The tactics themselves are the exact same ones the bourgeoisie used to seize power like in the French and American Revolutions. ",

        "Talking birds, also known as psittacines, are known for their ability to mimic human speech and other sounds. However, the extent to which they understand the meaning of what they are saying is still a topic of scientific debate.\n\nSome research suggests that talking birds may have a basic understanding of the meaning of certain words or phrases, especially when it comes to associating specific words with specific actions or objects. For example, a study published in the journal Animal Cognition found that an African grey parrot named Alex was able to learn and use over 100 words to communicate with his trainers.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the cognitive abilities of talking birds can vary widely depending on the species and individual bird. Some birds may have a more advanced understanding of language, while others may simply be mimicking sounds without any real comprehension.\n\nIt's also worth noting that many videos of talking birds appear to show the birds mimicking their owners or other humans, which can give the impression that they are having a conversation or understanding what they are saying. However, it's often difficult to determine the level of comprehension the bird has in these situations.\n\nOverall, while some talking birds may have a basic understanding of language, it's unlikely that they have the same level of cognitive abilities as humans or other animals. Their ability to mimic speech is still an impressive and fascinating phenomenon, but it's important to approach claims of bird intelligence with a healthy dose of skepticism.",

[MALE] was delighted to have the help and showed them how to plant and care for the plants.\n\nAs the children worked alongside [MALE], they asked him why he had started the garden. [MALE] explained that he wanted to make a positive difference in the community and bring people together. The children were inspired by his words and asked if they could join in on the clean-up initiatives.\n\nFrom that day forward, the children became regular volunteers in the garden and in the clean-up initiatives. They learned valuable lessons about the importance of community and the impact that one person can have on making a positive change.\n\nThanks to [MALE]'s efforts, the community was transformed, and a new generation of community leaders was born. The story of [MALE]'s dedication and the impact it had on the community served as a reminder that even the smallest actions can make a big difference.",

He can also replace the character X with any digit, but it must be the same for every character X.\n\nAs a note, a leading zero is any 0 digit that comes before the first nonzero digit in a number string in positional notation. For example, 0025 has two leading zeroes.

An A+, on the other hand, is considered an exceptional grade, indicating that the student has exceeded the expected standards and demonstrated an outstanding level of achievement.\n\nIt's worth noting that the specific grading criteria and boundaries may vary depending on the institution, department, or even individual instructor.

    "output_1": "I'm in a bit of a rush right now so sorry for an overly brief answer. This question deserves a veritable essay.\n\nThere's *loads* of ways of interpreting the *Iliad* along the lines you mention. There's no evidence for many of the *specific* symbolisms you suggest, though; Helen was sort of iconic of adultery, but the others not so much.\n\nThere's no doubt that, as a poem of its own time, the *Iliad* dissects the relationship between hero and community and does so pretty exhaustively and ruthlessly (Achilleus isn't spared much). In the Classical period this interpretation was still in vogue, but Sophokles' plays in particular go about hammering the point home still more. In his *Aias*, for example, Aias stands for what has been called \"the heroic temper\" against the democratic and demagogic tendencies of his community (represented by Menelaos and Odysseus, in very different ways). In that play (and in some other plays like the *Oedipus*) Sophokles broadcasts a message that there's something *inherently destructive* about great heroism.\n\nThis is a message that is also in the *Iliad*, though less explicitly: a large part of the problem in the *Iliad* is: how do you deal with having someone like Achilleus in your midst? He merits special treatment, of course, like any hero; but does he merit the *special special* treatment that he demands in book 9? When the embassy goes to visit him, they're expecting that he'll take compensation for Agamemnon's insult, because *that's how things work*: if there were a heroic code, one of the first rules would surely be \"when a wrong is done, payment is exacted\". When he refuses, they're stunned with incomprehension, because *he's not playing the part* that they'd expect of themselves.\n\nNow, to get back to the question you actually asked: I'd suggest taking a look, if you have time, at Stanford's book *The Ulysses Theme* (1958, I think) which covers the reception and interpretation of Odysseus throughout Greco-Roman antiquity and into the modern period. He draws out nicely the changing interpretations of his cunning. By the time Vergil got to him, Odysseus was an icon of deception and villainy; in the tragedies of the fifth century BCE, by contrast, he could still be *either* a villainous cad *or* an icon of wisdom, because that's how philosophers of the time were seen. Helen also had some interpretations dedicated to her, like Gorgias' *Encomium of Helen*, which tries to show -- subversively! -- that she was *not* an adulterous villainess.",
    "output_2": "One thing to think about while you consider this is that the way that ancient Greeks did not read the Iliad, but rather listened to trained singers reciting the poem. This means that it was usually listened to in a community fashion, and that it was not listened to in consecutive order. Singers could choose which parts of the story to highlight, and with what emotional emphasis to perform. Homer was considered the greatest poet by the Greeks, and the Iliad and the Odyssey informed and provided a basis for all later writers (who explored the stories in widely varying ways). My own thinking is that you cannot simply the Iliad to a single theme or group of themes; it is the culmination, or rather the gathering-up, of many of the myths of Homer's time.",

This can help children differentiate between right and wrong, and encourage them to empathize with the hero's journey and struggle. Additionally, simplifying complex issues into good vs. evil can make the story more accessible and engaging for a younger audience.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all children's films follow this formula. Many modern animated movies and TV shows, such as \"Inside Out,\" \"Zootopia,\" and \"Adventure Time,\" tackle complex themes and present nuanced, multi-dimensional characters. These stories can help children develop critical thinking skills, empathy, and an understanding of the gray areas in life.\n\nFilmmakers may also consider the age and developmental stage of their target audience when creating stories. Children under the age of 8 may have difficulty understanding complex moral dilemmas, so filmmakers may choose to present simpler, more black and white scenarios. As children grow older, they can handle more nuanced stories that explore gray areas and moral ambiguities.\n\nUltimately, the decision to portray conflicts in a black and white manner depends on the filmmakers' goals, the target audience, and the story they want to tell. While some children's films may present a simplistic view of good and evil, others can provide a more nuanced exploration of complex issues, helping children develop a deeper understanding of the world around them.",

        "I understand your point. The argument for mandatory organ donation, based on the principle of prioritizing the right to life over individual autonomy, is similar in structure to the argument against abortion. However, there are important ethical and practical differences between the two issues that make it difficult to directly apply the same principle.\n\nFirstly, pregnancy and organ donation are fundamentally different in terms of the physical and emotional impact on the individual. Pregnancy involves a significant physical and hormonal change, and caring for a child can be a lifelong commitment. Organ donation, on the other hand, is a relatively simple medical procedure with minimal physical impact on the donor.\n\nSecondly, the concept of \"brain death\" is a medically recognized definition of death, whereas the beginning of human life is a more debated and subjective issue. The ethical considerations surrounding the end of life are different from those surrounding the beginning of life.\n\nThirdly, there are concerns about the potential exploitation of individuals who are required to donate their organs. Mandatory organ donation could lead to a situation where some individuals are coerced into donating their organs against their will, or where their bodies are used for profit without their consent.\n\nLastly, there are alternative ways to address the shortage of organs for transplantation, such as increasing public awareness about organ donation, improving access to healthcare, and investing in research and development of artificial organs.\n\nIn conclusion, while the argument for mandatory organ donation based on the principle of prioritizing the right to life is understandable, it is important to consider the unique ethical and practical considerations surrounding organ donation and to explore alternative solutions that respect individual autonomy",

Death penalty convictions cost exorbitantly more than convictions resulting in life with out parole. This is almost almost always constant in every jurisdiction and every case that uses the death penalty as a form of punishment in the United States. The high cost associated with special trials, special provisions for death row prisoners as well as expensive drugs puts excessive strain on a criminal justice system that is already plagued with financial mismanagement. In addition to the cost, the USA often makes mistakes in death penalty cases. Some studies estimate up to 4% of individuals put to death were not guilty of the crimes they were convicted of. The irreversible nature of death means that there is no way for the justice system to right its wrongs should an innocent person be executed. The final reason that lethal injection is not preferable is the fact that it is not a deterrent for crimes. There is no evidence pointing to a decrease in high crime associated with the institution of capital punishment. Because of its cost, irreversibility, and, lack of effectiveness as a deterrent, lethal injection is less favorable than life without parole.  edit-grammar",

Additionally, there have been instances where lethal injection has been botched, leading to prolonged suffering and violating the condemned person's right to a humane death.\n\nSecondly, the criminal justice system is designed to provide opportunities for rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders back into society. While some crimes may be so heinous that they warrant a life sentence without parole, it's important to consider the possibility of redemption and the potential for offenders to make amends for their crimes.\n\nLastly, the legal system is designed to ensure that the guilty are punished, but also to protect the innocent from wrongful convictions. The use of lethal injection would eliminate the possibility of correcting wrongful convictions, as there would be no opportunity for appeals or exoneration.\n\nIn summary, while the desire for justice is understandable, the use of lethal injection as a punishment raises ethical and legal concerns.

The suspension was overturned on appeal, following an outcry from fans and players, including James Haskell and Andy Goode, who felt that the ban was unfair as there was no intent to harm. The appeal panel concluded that the incident occurred accidentally and that no act of foul play took place.

Anyways, if you don't know what Ramadan is, look up some specifics on it but a brief description is that Muslims cannot eat from dawn to dusk for a month long period, as well as other rules such as no touching/intimacy with loved ones, ingesting water, taking medications, etc. \n\nWithout food or drink, during the blazing hot summer, you'd think someone would get a little moody. Truth. My boyfriend's dad is going nuts. He normally is every other 11 months of the year, but currently, it's some sort of ongoing insecurities with my boyfriend also stepping up in his adulthood by getting his licence, a career and paying bills, all in sequence. I don't know if that has something to do with it but I believe it does, as he is the eldest (by over 10 years) and his dad has some cultural expectations for him, as well as threats of throwing him out of the house, not doing enough for his mom, and so forth. To say in the least, it's very hard to witness and hear about. \n\nSo I'm writing this asking any other Redditors if you have every had a SO with a personal choice or a parents' influence to do Ramadan, and how you (as a non-participator) felt/dealt with it? \n\nAlso, how can I stop feeling distaste towards his dad, as I see this  packing on more and more emotional weight on my SO?",

The Simulation Hypothesis has been a topic of debate in philosophy, physics, and popular culture, with proponents and opponents presenting various arguments for and against it.\n\nSome arguments in favor of the Simulation Hypothesis include:\n\n1. The \"fine-tuning\" of the universe: Some scientists argue that the fundamental physical constants in our universe are so finely tuned that it's highly unlikely they occurred by chance. The Simulation Hypothesis offers an explanation for this fine-tuning, suggesting that our universe was designed by a simulator for a specific purpose.\n2.

        "Hi there! I'm happy to help you find the perfect icing for your daughter's birthday cake.\n\nIf you're looking for a light and fluffy icing that pairs well with chocolate and can be colored in different shades, I would recommend using a Swiss meringue buttercream. This type of icing is made with egg whites, sugar, and butter, and it has a light, airy texture that's perfect for creating a unicorn and rainbow design.\n\nTo make a Swiss meringue buttercream, you'll need to start by heating the egg whites and sugar in a double boiler until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is hot. Then, you'll need to whip the mixture with an electric mixer until it cools and becomes stiff and glossy. Once it's cooled, you can add in softened butter and mix until it's fully incorporated.\n\nThe great thing about Swiss meringue buttercream is that it can be colored in different shades using food coloring, so you can create a beautiful rainbow effect on your daughter's cake. It's also a very stable icing, so it will hold its shape well and won't melt or become runny, even in warmer temperatures.\n\nAnother option you could consider is a whipped cream cheese icing. This icing is made with softened cream cheese, butter, and powdered sugar, and it has a light, creamy texture that's perfect for a chocolate cake. You can also add in different flavorings, such as vanilla or almond extract, to give the icing a unique taste.",

When milk is liquid, these proteins are stable and don't clump together [1]. When you add acid to the mix, the proteins break down and start attaching to each other, causing milk to curdle [1, 2]. Second, coffee and tea contain just enough acidity to tip the pH of milk to the point of curdling [3, 4]. The effect is most often seen in milk that is close to going sour or when adding milk to very hot coffee or tea, since the high temperature can coagulate casein [3, 4]. The increased acidity of the milk also causes it to taste sour [2, 3]. The protein molecules can stick together or coagulate into the clumps known as curds [2, 3]. The watery liquid that remains is called whey [2]. Creamer tends to leave small circles of curdled milk in your coffee because the proteins in the dairy products repel each other so they can distribute evenly through the liquid [2]. ",

[1] Coffee creamer will also lighten up coffee, so it is ideal for those who do not enjoy their coffee black and are lactose intolerant. [1] However, milk will do a better job than creamer when it comes to flavor. Milk will be high in fat and protein, which will make the coffee taste smooth and sweet.

In many species, including mammals and birds, individuals with certain physical characteristics are considered more attractive and desirable as mates. These characteristics can include bright colors, symmetrical patterns, and other visual cues that signal health, fertility, and high social status.\n\nHowever, nonverbal cues, such as body language, scent, and vocalizations, also play a significant role in animal communication and mate selection. For example, a peacock's elaborate courtship display, which includes spreading its colorful tail feathers and emitting a distinctive call, is an important factor in attracting a mate. Similarly, a male mouse's ability to produce a high-pitched ultrasonic song can increase its chances of attracting a female.\n\nIn summary, physical beauty in the animal kingdom is not just about physical appearance but also includes nonverbal cues that signal an individual's health, social status, and reproductive fitness.",

Processing: The brain analyzes and interprets the information, identifying patterns, objects, and emotions.\n3. Memory: The brain stores information in short-term and long-term memory. Short-term memory lasts for a few seconds, while long-term memory can store information for years.\n4. Attention: Our brain focuses on certain information or tasks, filtering out distractions.\n5. Working memory: This is the ability to hold and manipulate information in our minds for a short time. It's crucial for tasks like mental math or following instructions.\n6. Executive functions: These high-level cognitive processes include decision-making, problem-solving, planning, and critical thinking.\n7.

    "output_1": "People do grow out of their asthma. People are still unsure exactly why, but one idea is that as you get older, your airways get wider. And that's all asthma is - a narrowing of the airways making it hard to breathe. \n\nThere's a lot of things that cause it. Doing things that tire you out like exercise, cold air, pollution. It can be because irritants get in your lungs, or something triggers your body to defend itself when it doesn't really need to (we call this allergies). This makes your air passages tighten and grow small, like clenching a fist. And that makes it harder for air to get in and out, which you need to live.\n\nThat's why it's important for people with asthma to carry their medicine, which they puff in to their lungs. This tells the lungs to relax,  making the airways wider.",
    "output_2": "Asthmatic here. A simple explanation for asthma is a condition in which the airway to the lungs narrows and becomes clogged with a mucus that, if not treated, may completely close the airway and prevent the individual from breathing. Why does the mucus appear, you ask? Everybody's body can produce this mucus, and can do so if the lung becomes infected or the body thinks something is trying to attack the lungs. The mucus acts as a barrier to prevent further damage. However, with asthmatics, the lungs tend to glitch out and occasionally think that they're being attacked when actually, the asthmatic may just be exercising or whatnot. Because the lungs think something's wrong, this mucus will occur and cause the individual some discomfort, or as we say \"my asthma is acting up.\"\n\nWhen you hear someone say \"my asthma is acting up,\" they're probably referring to wheeziness, pressure on the chest, coughing, lung pain, or a shortness of breath. \n\nEverybody's asthma is triggered differently, but primary culprits are exercise, pollen, smog, stress, change in temperature, extreme temperatures, dry/humid weather, and so many more. What triggers one asthmatic's asthma to act up could not affect another asthmatic at all, so it really depends. \n\nOccasionally, people grow out of their asthma. This is usually the case in teenagers who had asthma in their childhood. Along with all the other changes that happen to their body during puberty, the asthma \"glitch\" can simply fade away.",

Can I ask you which way the wind was blowing the last few days? Do you know? Most people don't and that can have a huge effect on where the fish are. If the wind was blowing from the east, then the big fish will all be on the west side of the lake. A wind from the east blows all the bait fish to the west, and the bigger fish travel to eat them.\n\nWhat is the water level like on the lake? Is it rising, or falling, or staying the same. This effects the fishes behavior, and you should know how and why.\n\nWhat time of year is it? I'll fish different spots in the same lake, depending on the season. If I'm fishing for walleye in the spring I'm near the spawning areas. I have to look up, or find some knowledge of where those are but that's where I'll fish. In the summer I'll fish in the deeper water because lots of walleye focus on cisco's during that time. In the late fall I'll move to shallow water, perhaps stuff better suited to pike since walleye are feasting for the winter. \n\nWhat are the fish eating? You should know because it effects the hook you put on the line. Are they feasting on leaches? If so that's what your hook should look like. Walleye eat a lot of leaches in the spring, and that \"pattern\" almost always works, but in the fall you can bonk them on the head with a leach and they won't care.\n\nHave you tuned your lures? A lot of lures, especially crankbaits only work at a certain speed, with a certain line. Often you can bend and mold it with a pair of pliers but you need to have a good presentation to catch fish with them. A lure running off center won't catch wish.\n\nHow good it your equipment? It might sound silly but there is a big difference between a rod you buy at Walmart, and something that costs $200. With the more expensive rod you can feel what's going on at the end of your line, which means you're not limited to the ultra aggressive ones that almost hook them selves, but you can catch the fish that want to feel the bait before they eat it.\n\nCan you, or are you willing to change? A lot of people, heck a lot of communities think that there is only one way to catch fish on their lake. Maybe worms and a jig head off Murry point. What about a slip bobber and minnows? Or a sinker rig? Or reverse trolling a bottom bouncer? ",

This occurs when the gravitational forces between the planet and the Sun are strong enough to pull the planet's orbit into a stable, circular shape.\n\nThe reason why other objects in the solar system, such as dwarf planets, comets, and asteroids, have eccentric orbits is because they are not massive enough to have their orbits circularized by the gravitational forces of the Sun. These objects are also more likely to have been affected by gravitational interactions with other objects in the early solar system, which could have caused their orbits to become more eccentric.\n\nIt's worth noting that the planets didn't form in their current orbits. They formed in a different configuration and then migrated to their current positions through a process called planetary migration. This process occurred early in the solar system's history, when the planets were still forming and the Sun was still young.\n\nIn summary, the planets in our solar system have relatively circular orbits because they are massive enough to have their orbits circularized by the gravitational forces of the Sun, while other objects in the solar system are not massive enough to have their orbits circularized and have more eccentric orbits.",

Different populations have their unique genetic makeup, which can result in differences in physical traits such as skin tone, eye shape, and body proportion. For example, people from India and Bangladesh tend to have darker skin tones due to the region's geographical location and climate, while people from Pakistan and other parts of South Asia tend to have lighter skin tones.\n\nSecondly, climate and geography also play a significant role in shaping physical characteristics. People living in regions with extreme climates, such as hot deserts or cold mountains, tend to adapt physically to their environment. For example, people from the mountainous regions of Nepal and Bhutan tend to have stockier builds and thicker skin to adapt to the cold climate, while people from the hot and humid regions of India and Southeast Asia tend to have thinner skin and more sweat glands to regulate their body temperature.\n\nLastly, cultural practices and lifestyle can also influence physical characteristics. For example, people from certain regions may have different dietary habits, which can affect their physical appearance. Additionally, cultural practices such as binding feet or wearing certain types of clothing can also shape physical characteristics over time.\n\nIt's important to note that",

They had a choice of operating systems, and eventually decided to go with Microsoft (that's a story by itself, but we'll stick with the relevant stuff for now).\n\nDuring the negotiations, though, Microsoft won a key concession. IBM used Microsoft's operating system, called PC DOS, on their computers. But they won the right to also supply their own version of the software, called MS DOS. This meant that, unlike every other computer manufacturer, IBM were shipping a computer where they didn't own the sole rights to the operating system.\n\nAside from the operating system, most of the other components of the IBM PC were available off the shelf. The only exception was the BIOS, but this turned out to be relatively easy to reverse-engineer, find out how it worked, and build something similar enough to be compatible.\n\nAnd so the \"IBM PC Compatible\" computer was born - a computer which was not made by IBM, but which would run all the same software as IBM computers. This resulted in a huge surge of software for IBM PC Compatible computers, which resulted in more of those computers being sold, and so more software was written, etc - it developed into a self-sustaining growth.\n\nAnd to get back to your original question, those IBM computers used Intel chips. And so IBM PC Compatible computers also used Intel chips. And almost every PC ever sold since then has been based on the same technology, or evolutions of the same technology.",
    "output_2": "Originally, Windows, Windows was written for x86 and all their apps were written for x86, switching processors would require changes to practically every application. It's not impossible (Microsoft did make Windows NT for PPC), but it's a cost they don't want to do unless they have to.\n\nProbably more relevant though, the modern architecture of modern processors means the processor doesn't matter that much if you want speed. The newer x86 CPUs use the instruction set as a kind of byte code, they don't directly execute it, but instead treat them as RISC instructions that get compiled into CISC instructions at a hardware level during execution (essentially means the instructions are not executed the way you ask the processor to execute them, it reorders and combines them). When a processor does that, that step can include conversions between the x86 spec, and how the processor actually does things so the instruction set has only a minor effect on performance. Therefore switching architectures doesn't make a whole lot of a difference. Today everything uses x86 on desktop and server because it's the fastest processor with the best overall performance.\n\nAs for ARM, it's popular for a different reason, it's sold as an IP licenses core for use by anyone really. What that means is anyone can make an ARM processor, just have to pay the ARM people a royalty fee. The benefit is people building a SoC, like what's used on a cell phone that need minimum power usage. ARM can be modified to have appropriate specs (cache size, speed, usb enabled, etc) by editing a config file. Then the GPU manufacturer can stick the processor inside the GPU, and build it as one processor. They don't need to buy a physical chip from the ARM people.",

My great uncle has owned his property in Ohio for nearly 40 years. It was purchased from another family member.   Recently the family who owns the large wooded property behind my Uncles house have been approaching him saying that they have a 50 feet wide easement through his property. My uncle is very upset about this. These people have been very rude to both him and his wife. The part of his property they are claiming to be entitled to, has a large garden, well and other buildings on it.  Ive not been able to find any detail about such an easement on the deed. It just says the tract as surveys contains X acres, more or less, and is subject to all legal highways and easements of record.  \\-Where can I find these easements of record?   \\-Also, 50 feet wide also seems oversized for an easement. I always thought easements were the width of a vehicle with a couple feet on each side???  \\-The family claiming to have an easement did not own that land when my uncle purchased his property. Their property is also not landlocked, as part of it runs along the road.  \\-The family member my uncle purchased the property from has no recollection of an easement.   \\-My uncle had a survey done when he purchased the property.

Where can I find these easements of record?\nEasements of record can be found in the county recorder's office or online database. You can search for the property's deed and look for any mentions of easements. Additionally, you can check for any separate documents that may have been recorded, such as easement agreements or court orders.\n2. 50 feet wide seems oversized for an easement.\nYes, 50 feet is wider than a standard easement, which is typically the width of a vehicle plus a few feet on either side. However, easements can vary in width, and the specific dimensions may be specified in the easement agreement or court order.\n3. The family claiming the easement did not own the land when my uncle purchased his property.\nThis is a relevant point, as the easement would have had to have been established prior to your uncle's purchase of the property. If the family claiming the easement did not own the land at the time, it's possible that the easement was not properly established.\n4. The family member my uncle purchased the property from has no recollection of an easement.\nThis is also a significant factor, as the person who sold the property to your uncle should have been aware of any easements affecting the property. If they have no recollection of an easement, it may indicate that one does not exist.\n5. My uncle had a survey done when he purchased the property. There is no easement described on the survey.\nThis is helpful information, as a survey would typically note any easements affecting the property.

The paper showed that the human race is on a trend line toward becoming unable to reproduce itself due to the decline in sperm counts. The sperm count in 1973 was 99 million sperm per milliliter of semen, and in 2011, the number had dropped to 47 million per milliliter. [1]  Some scientists have been observing and debating the cause of the decline in sperm counts for decades. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, a number of studies suggested that sperm counts in men were on the decline, but these studies had been largely ignored or dismissed on the grounds that they had been subject to selection bias and/or the inclusion of data from men with fertility or testicular problems.

This research concluded that sperm counts went from 99 million sperm per milliliter in 1970 to 47 million in 2011 [2]. Some suggest that this decline is due to the environment, food and environmental toxins like preservatives, BPA, and similar chemicals found in plastics, fire retardants used in furniture, and many others [1]. Others hypothesized that the increase in endocrine-disrupting substances in the environment could be a contributing factor [1]. Another factor that could be having an impact is the sun, since ambient radiation could drive sperm decline [1]. Recently, a study conducted by a team of epidemiologists, clinicians, and researchers that culled data from 185 studies, showed that the human race is on a path to becoming unable to reproduce itself [2].",

It's often used as a substitute for \"yes\" or \"hell yeah.\" For example, someone might say, \"I'm going to the concert tonight!\" and someone else might respond with \"Ayyy, that's awesome!\"\n\n\"Ayyy lmao\" is a variation of \"Ayyy\" that adds \"lmao,\" which stands for \"laughing my ass off.\" This expression is used to convey that something is not only exciting or fun, but also hilarious. For example, someone might say, \"I just saw the funniest meme on Instagram!\" and someone else might respond with \"Ayyy lmao, I need to see that!\"\n\nSo, the main difference between \"Ayyy\" and \"Ayyy lmao\" is that the latter includes the additional phrase \"lmao,\" which emphasizes the humor or entertainment value of a situation. Both expressions are used to express enthusiasm or excitement, but \"Ayyy lmao\" adds an extra layer of laughter or amusement.\n\nAs for the origination, \"Ayyy\" is believed to have originated in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and has since been adopted by other communities online. \"Lmao\" is a more recent abbreviation that emerged with the rise of social media and text messaging.

So to make new synapses, the neurons would have to change on a cellular level. Surely this would take hours, or possibly days (or more) to happen.  So why is it, if (for example) someone tells me their name, I'm sometimes able to remember it immediately for a very long time despite only being exposed to that information for far too short of a time for my brain to physically change?",
    "output_1": "Separating memory and behaviours and perceptions has probably put back peoples understanding of brain function.   If you think of reflexes as a whole where some input makes certain neutrons fire which go into the central nervous system to connect eventually with an out put - maybe like motor neuron firing.   Now consider that there are simple reflexes and we understand those 2 or 3 neuron ones pretty well. Some inputs go into the huge labyrinth of connections in the brain. It is here that complex interactions between millions of reflexes can alter output. The static connection total or connectome alone can process, resonate, separate certain inputs into perceptions, and use these to build simulations of existence and choice options for actions which I would think is what we perceive as subjective experience.   This process is as quick as neuronal firing. But the whole complex structure of interlinking resonances and pathways which can already inhibit or promote certain resonances and pathways can adapt the connections themselves to provide for long term easy access to certain modes. This is what many people refer to as longer term learning.   Memorising simply means being able to repeat in my opinion. The resonances and changes that the complex brain connections can form is already enough to encode and hold things almost instantly but you may require longer term synaptic remodelling to be easily able to return to the resonance pattern in the neuron system years later without experiencing the same input patterns. Equally the remodelling over years may mean that in the future you might not experience the same activation of pathways even if you experience almost the same input patterns.",

        "Great question! It's true that forming new synapses and strengthening existing ones does take time, and it's a process that involves changes at the cellular level. However, the brain has a way to quickly form new memories and learn new information without necessarily creating new synapses.\n\nThe process is called synaptic plasticity, which allows the strength of existing synapses to change based on experience. When you learn new information, the neurons in your brain that are connected to the new information become more active, and the connections between them become stronger. This process is thought to happen through a mechanism called long-term potentiation (LTP), which increases the strength of the connections between neurons.\n\nLTP is a rapid process that can happen in a matter of minutes or even seconds, and it's thought to be the basis for short-term memory. So, when you meet someone and learn their name, the connection between the neurons that represent their name and your memory of it becomes stronger, and you're able to recall it later.\n\nAdditionally, the brain has a way to consolidate memories, which means that the information you've learned is transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory. This process happens during sleep, and it involves changes at the molecular level that make the memories more stable and less likely to be forgotten.\n\nSo, to summarize, the brain is able to learn and memorize things quickly through synaptic plasticity and LTP, which allow existing connections between neurons to become stronger, and through memory consolidation, which transfers information from short-term memory to long-term memory during sleep.",

The Koran contains passages that are sympathetic to the suffering of people who are homosexual.  However, it also many religious leaders to seek to exclude gay people from participation in Muslim communities by some declaring homosexuality to be forbidden or sinful.  There is also a great deal of debate among Muslims about how to apply religious principles about homosexuality, and many Muslims practice Islam while also supporting legal rights for gay people.  Despite this complex debate among Muslims, Islam does have a strong tradition of religious freedom and inclusion, including for gay people.\n\nHuman: How do Muslims compromise their modern progressive view of homosexuality with the Koran's criticisms of it?\n\nAssistant: For many Muslims, the Koran presents homosexuality as a morally suspect condition that is to be rejected.  But it also prescribes that there be many different interpretations of scripture.  So when it comes to homosexuality, some Muslims take the interpretation that it should be condemned, and others have suggested that the Koran could instead be read to mean that it should be tolerated.  How to resolve this disagreement is an important topic for debate in Muslim communities.\n\nHuman: Isn't one of the differences between the Koran and the bible is that the Koran is \"un-alterable\", and there aren't supposed to be many different interpretations?\n\nAssistant:",

But other passages may also be interpreted as indicating that the Koran's message is a bit contingent, and that it was not meant to be interpreted in a one-size-fits-all manner.  In addition to this, there are several different ancient translations of the Koran that often conflict.  This suggests that there is a degree of flexibility built into the message of the Koran, which has been helpful to allow different interpretations to develop and persist.  Still, some Muslims emphasize the idea that the Koran is a \"divine revelation\" that is unchanging, and is only subject to human interpretation insofar that it is meant to be understood.  Muslims in general are inclined to believe the Koran has a largely fixed meaning, which remains relevant in all times and places, but there is also significant disagreement within Muslim communities about how to correctly understand the Koran.",
    "output_2": " The concept of there being only one true interpretation of scripture comes from a tradition of jurisprudence called \"ijtihad\" that was developed centuries after the Koran was written.  Ijtihad was used to provide a single, unchanging interpretation of Islamic law, but it is often criticized as being inconsistent with the Koran's commands to respect difference of opinion.",

The goal is to find two integers, l and r, such that the sum of the numbers between them (inclusive) is equal to a given target number n. The twist in this problem is that the range is bounded by 10^18, which is a very large number.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that involves iterating over the possible ranges and checking if the sum of the numbers within that range is equal to the target number.\n\nHere's a concise solution in Python:\n```python\ndef range_sum(n):\n    for l in range(-10**18, 10**18):\n        r = l + n - 1\n        if r >= 0 and r <= 10**18:\n            return l, r\n    return None\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the code works:\n\n1. We define a function `range_sum` that takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. We use a for loop to iterate over the possible ranges. The loop starts at -10^18 and ends at 10^18.\n3. Inside the loop, we calculate the sum of the numbers within the current range by using the formula `r = l + n - 1`.\n4. We check if the sum `r` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10^18. If it is, we return the range `l` and `r`.\n5. If we don't find a valid range, we return `None`.\n\nNow, let",

Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the gcd of x and y. Let d be the gcd.\n2. Compute x' = x/d and y' = y/d.

Check if n is within the given range (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^{18}). If it's not, repeat steps 1-3 with a different value of d until you find an n that satisfies the range constraint.\n\nHere's an example of how this solution works for the first test case:\n\nx = 4, y = 8\n\n1. gcd(4, 8) = 2\n2. x' = 4/2 = 2, y' = 8/2 = 4\n3. n = 2 \\* 4 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, n = 8 satisfies the condition and is within the given range.\n\nFor the second test case:\n\nx = 4, y = 2",

        "Well poisoning, as depicted in fiction, is a common espionage activity in medieval times. However, there isn't much historical evidence to support its use in reality.\n\nIn medieval times, wells were a vital source of water for communities, and poisoning them would have had severe consequences for the people who relied on them. It's possible that enemies might have considered poisoning wells as a means of weakening their opponents, but there are few recorded instances of this happening.\n\nOne of the few recorded instances of well poisoning occurred during the Crusades, when Muslim forces were accused of poisoning the wells of Christian armies. However, these claims are not supported by concrete evidence and may have been propaganda or rumors.\n\nIn fiction, well poisoning is often used as a means of creating chaos, destroying enemy forces, or gaining a strategic advantage. The goals of well poisoning in fiction typically involve weakening the enemy, creating fear and panic, or paving the way for a military victory.\n\nIn summary, while well poisoning may have been considered as a means of espionage in medieval times, there is little historical evidence to support its use in reality. Its use in fiction is mostly for dramatic effect and to create a sense of tension and danger.",

While they are categorized by year (Baroque lasting from roughly 1600-1750, Classical from 1750-1800, and Romantic from 1800-1900, all being rough), they are different from each other. \n\nThe early Baroque is mainly funded by rich merchants but slowly spread across Europe till the style is widely diffused to all of Europe, famously ending with J.S. Bach. By the end of the Baroque era, music was being paid for (the royalty or rich being patrons of the musicians) by Royalty. A composer would either be paid to write a piece or dedicate it to a member of royalty. This would be the main method of music production (within the Classical genre as folk music still existed) until the early Romantic Era (first few decades of the 19th century).\n\nThe change came due to a rising middle class. In Vienna, there were a multitude of middle class workers that would play music for themselves.  The composer Franz Schubert best exemplifies it, often he would compose music for his friends and play it for them at parties they threw. From here, romantic composers would start to compose music for profit to the middle class; Antonin Dvorak wrote many String Quartets that were specifically written to sell.\n\nFast forward a few decades from Schubert and you'll find the Strauss family writing waltzes. These waltzes weren't for the nobility but for the public to dance to, which were of course sold so people may play them.

The other two joints automatically follow that joint's lead, producing a fixed pattern of motion [1]. However, researchers have solved part of the problem of smooth motor control by connecting an artificial limb to a different part of the brain [3].

There are two main reasons why bionic limbs appear to have stilted, unrealistic animations. The first is because they are controlled by electrical energy, which can be amplified, processed, and utilized to control the movement of a motor in an artificial limb [2]. The second reason is because the limbs are not connected to the skeleton, which limits the range of motion and activates mechanoreceptors that trigger sensations of stretching skin when the harness or suction that attaches the limb to the body is activated [4].",

        "Prosthetic limbs and robotic puppets have different design goals and constraints, which can affect their animations and movements. Here are some possible reasons why bionic hands/arms may have stilted and unrealistic animations compared to a natural-looking robot puppet:\n\n1. Functionality vs. Aesthetics: Prosthetic limbs are designed to perform specific tasks and functions, such as grasping and holding objects, while also ensuring the safety and comfort of the user. These considerations may take precedence over aesthetics, resulting in a less natural-looking movement. In contrast, a robot puppet's primary goal is often to entertain or demonstrate a concept, with a focus on appearance and fluid motion.\n2. Weight and Materials: Prosthetic limbs are typically made of heavier, more durable materials to ensure they can handle the stresses and strains of everyday use. This can make it more challenging to achieve the same level of fluidity and natural movement as a lightweight puppet made of materials like styrofoam or plastic.\n3. Control Systems: Prosthetic limbs often use different control systems than robotic puppets. Prosthetics may rely on electromyography (EMG) signals from the user's muscles or advanced algorithms to control the limb's movements. These systems may not be able to replicate the same level of nuance and natural movement as a puppet controlled by a human operator or advanced AI.\n4. Inverse Kinematics: As you mentioned, inverse kinematics (IK) is a technique used to create natural-looking movements in robotics. However, implementing IK in prosthetic limbs can be more complex due to factors like sensorimot",

For example, the tax code included provisions such as the \"excess profits tax\" which targeted companies that were seen as profiteering during wartime.\n\nAdditionally, the 94% tax rate was part of a broader set of policies aimed at reducing income inequality, such as the National Recovery Administration's codes and the Fair Labor Standards Act, which established minimum wages and overtime protections for workers.\n\nOverall, while the 94% tax rate was not a panacea, it was an important tool in addressing income inequality and raising revenue for the government during a time of economic crisis.",

He listens to all basic commands and makes good eye contact most of the time. He is quite defensive of the yard and property. If someone comes to the door or a loud car drives by he barks and growls. He quickly quiets down when you ask him to. (Most of the time except when he is in the yard alone) He gets along very well with other dogs and people. If someone new is coming to the house he is standoffish at first but quickly is very friendly. (As long as I say its ok) He is well excercised for the most part. (Walk to a field and then 45 minutes+ of running/fetch/frisbee) In the winter time he goes outside less but doesn't seem to act any differently. I do alot of indoor training/play with him as well.\n\nThe other day my friends phone rang and he stood up about to answered it. At the same time my dog started growling and attacked him. He stopped after a few seconds (gave him sit commands etc) but was still very heated. My friend went in the other room for his phone call and it seemed like my dog wanted to follow him. We both thought the ringtone agitated him.\n\nAre there any clear cut training methods to stop this behavior? It happened twice now with two different people. He is completely fine with the person before and shortly after it happens. It really comes out of nowhere. I have tried to replicate the scenario but haven't been able to. I have also shown him a ringing phone etc.\n\nAlso if anyone has tips about making him less defensive of the yard it would be great! Sometimes he barks at people that are 4+ houses away.

        "This is a classic problem of finding a valid sequence of weights and sides such that the balance is maintained according to the given string. The problem can be solved using dynamic programming.\n\nThe idea is to create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum weight that can be placed on the j-th side of the balance such that the balance is still maintained, assuming that the first i weights have already been placed.\n\nThe base case is dp[0][0] = 0, as no weights have been placed yet.\n\nFor each weight A_i, we can place it on either the left or the right side of the balance. Let's consider the maximum weight that can be placed on each side:\n\n* If we place A_i on the left side, the maximum weight that can be placed on the right side is dp[i-1][1] - A_i, as the right side should be heavier.\n* If we place A_i on the right side, the maximum weight that can be placed on the left side is dp[i-1][0] - A_i, as the left side should be heavier.\n\nTherefore, the maximum weight that can be placed on the j-th side of the balance, assuming that the first i weights have already been placed, is:\n\ndp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][1] - A_i, dp[i-1][0] - A_i)\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of weights and sides that maximizes the weight placed on the heavier side of the balance. This can be found by tracing back the table dp and finding the path that leads to the maximum weight.\n\nThe time complexity",

Often, a random mistake in the bacteria's DNA will create a gene that gives the bacteria resistance to antibiotics [3]. Every time a multiplication event happens, there is a chance that a mutation like this will occur, because bacteria multiply a lot [3]. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) is a strain of bacteria that is resistant to an antibiotic called vancomycin [4]. VRE has been around for over thirty years, and scientists have been able to group different strains of VRE according to how they defend themselves against vancomycin [4].

        "Bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics through various mechanisms, such as:\n\n1. Genetic mutations: Bacteria can develop genetic mutations that make them less susceptible to the effects of antibiotics.\n2. Selection pressure: When exposed to antibiotics, bacteria that are most susceptible to the antibiotic will die off, leaving behind bacteria that are more resistant.\n3. Horizontal gene transfer: Bacteria can share genes with other bacteria, including genes that confer antibiotic resistance.\n\nThis process can occur in one body, as well as in the wider environment. For example, if a person takes antibiotics, the bacteria in their body that are susceptible to the antibiotic will die off, leaving behind any bacteria that are resistant. These resistant bacteria can then multiply and spread, making the antibiotic less effective.\n\nThe difference between bacteria that are resistant and bacteria that are more tolerant to certain antibiotics is that resistant bacteria have developed a mechanism to actively counteract the antibiotic, whereas tolerant bacteria have simply developed a higher threshold for the antibiotic's effectiveness. In other words, resistant bacteria are able to survive and multiply even in the presence of the antibiotic, while tolerant bacteria may still be affected by the antibiotic but can survive in lower concentrations.\n\nIt's important to note that antibiotic resistance is a growing concern globally, as it can make bacterial infections more difficult to treat and increase the risk of spreading resistant b",

Direct flights from Milwaukee, WI to LAX to visit my family for the first time in two years due to the pandemic.  The night before our return trip, we got an email from Spirit saying that our flight was cancelled, and strangely, \"not to try to call or come to the airport\".  The news showed that Spirit had been dealing with this issue for 3 days at that time, with people stranded at the airport for 30 hours in some cases.   We called Spirit multiple times to try to find another flight.  At first, their phone lines would pick up and we'd hold for about an hour and then it would automatically hang up on us.  Eventually, their phone line stopped taking calls and had an automated message that said to use their online chat feature and then hung up on us.  We tried that, but it was unable to book flights with other carriers or offer hotel or food vouchers (the replacement flights Spirit originally offered us all ended up getting cancelled two days later).  I sent an email to Spirit's email complaint forms prior to our expected departure time, stating that we were stranded and sought to get a flight through another carrier, and never heard back from that.  I also went to the airport to extend our rental car and stood in line with Spirit for hours to no avail.  In short, we were stranded in LA with no way to get home and no way to get ahold of the airline we'd booked with and no budget for our extra stay.  We ended up finding the best deal we could find on a flight home through United two days later (flights the same day were over $1000/ticket) and just putting it on a credit card, hopeful that we could fight it out with Spirit if/when we could finally get in touch with them.   The cheapest we could find was $870.40 one-way for the two of us with our dog, two days later (and with a lay-over).  We extended our rental car, and booked the cheapest hotel we could find that would take our dog.  Not to mention, we had to feed ourselves for those days and miss work.  We arrived home late last night.  I've tried to call Spirit multiple times today with no luck.  I was on hold for nearly 30 mins just now and then was hung up on automatically.    Spirit's CEO keeps carefully phrasing his apologies to include things like \"weather\" which I imagine they'll hope to use to get out of their contract with passengers, however it seems clear that this issue had more to do with overbooking and under-staffing and their own operational issues as they've also apologized for publicly.  At this point, Spirit's poor management decisions cost us over $1700 just to get home from this trip (not including our food and loss of work).  Are there any legal avenues to get compensated by a company like Spirit in this situation?  Is small claims court an option?  Any help would be deeply appreciated, as these unexpected expenses all went on credit cards this week.  Thank you!",

        "Sorry to hear that you had a frustrating experience with Spirit Airlines. It's understandable that you're looking for ways to get compensated for the unexpected expenses you incurred.\n\nSmall claims court could be an option for you to pursue compensation from Spirit Airlines. In most states, small claims court is designed to handle disputes involving relatively small amounts of money, typically up to $5,000 or $10,000.\n\nTo determine if small claims court is the right option for your situation, you may want to consider the following factors:\n\n1. Jurisdiction: Check if the small claims court in your state has jurisdiction over Spirit Airlines. You can do this by checking the airline's terms and conditions or contacting their customer service department to ask if they have a specific jurisdiction clause in their contracts.\n2. Amount of damages: Calculate the total amount of damages you incurred as a result of Spirit Airlines' actions, including the cost of the replacement flight, hotel, food, and any lost wages. If the amount is less than the jurisdictional limit of your state's small claims court, it may be a viable option.\n3. Evidence: Gather all the evidence you have to support your claim, such as receipts, emails, and phone records. You'll need to prove that Spirit Airlines' actions caused you harm and that you took reasonable steps to mitigate your losses.\n4. Time and effort: Consider the time and effort involved in pursuing a small claims court case. You'll need to file a complaint, serve Spirit Airlines with the complaint, and prepare for a hearing.

A week later we received an email from them saying, \"[Venue] has contacted us to say you are getting married there. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding, it's time to pick an officiant and confirm all of these details regarding the location, date, time, and overall vibe of your ceremony.\" I replied back saying I had already been in contact to request an officiant and I answered ALL of her questions, and said that we were still in the process of confirming our ceremony time and that I would let her know ASAP. The next day I emailed again to confirm ceremony time, and within ten minutes I received a reply from her saying, \"Thanks for confirming your ceremony time, can you answer everything else now?\" Uhm, I already did. So I replied back answering all of her questions again and reiterating our interest in this one specific officiant. Three days go by and I receive ANOTHER email from her saying, \"Great, now all that is left to do is confirm your ceremony time and we can check if the officiant you want is available.\" Arg!

According to Denuvo, it stops the reverse engineering and debugging required to crack a game [1]. Denuvo works by pre-emptively encrypting a software's instructions and then decrypting the instructions in real-time to execute on the CPU [2]. It downloads the rest of files, encrypts those files, and ties those files to your hardware, making it so only you can play that game on that specific hardware [2, 5]. When a new major update is released, or there is a change in hardware, Denuvo replaces those files and reties them to your current hardware [2]. Denuvo claims this has no perceptible effect on game performance nor is Denuvo to blame for any game crashes of genuine executables [4].",
    "output_2": "Denuvo DRM is integrated into the codebase of a game during development, so a programmer can rewrite or optimize the code without compromising its security [1]. Denuvo runs as a background process with its own PID or thread in the game, rather than as a single check at the start of the game, which would be easy to bypass [1]. Each time a game is launched, Denuvo's validation code gets inserted right into the middle of the code stream for every invocation instead of calling a function, making it difficult to bypass [1]. A \"ticket\" is generated for each installation on an individual PC, containing system information like CPU architecture, number of processors and cores, and attached storage with physical parameters [1]. This information is used to generate a fingerprint of a specific system, which is used to unlock the game [2]. Since Denuvo's role is to protect data and prevent cracking, its exact methods are kept a secret, but it is known that it enables game companies to still develop their games as normal and for Steam, Origin and Uplay clients to distribute and manage them as normal [3].",

It works by pre-emptively encrypting a software's instructions and then decrypting the instructions in real-time to execute on the CPU.\n\nRegarding your question, it's not possible to simply grab the key used to decrypt the instructions from the RAM because the key is not stored in the RAM. The key is securely stored in a hardware-based secure storage area, such as the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) or the Secure Enclave, which is not accessible to the user or any software.\n\nWhen the software is executed, the CPU sends a request to the secure storage area to retrieve the decryption key. The secure storage area then sends the key back to the CPU, which uses it to decrypt the instructions. This process happens rapidly, in real-time, to ensure that the software executes smoothly and without any noticeable delay.\n\nAdditionally, Denuvo DRM also implements various other security measures, such as code obfuscation, anti-tampering techniques, and hardware-based security checks, to make it even more difficult for attackers to reverse-engineer or tamper with the software.\n\nIn summary, Denuvo DRM's secure storage area and real-time decryption mechanism make it difficult to extract the decryption key from the RAM, making it an effective way to protect software from reverse-engineering and tampering.",

Transaction fees: Many exchange stores charge fees for buying or selling currencies, especially for low-value transactions.\n3. Commission: Some stores may charge a commission on the total amount exchanged.\n4. Selling additional services: Some stores may offer additional services, such as travel insurance, money transfer services, or prepaid travel cards, and earn a commission from these sales.\n5.

    "output_2": "It's not \"angular force,\" assuming that you mean torque.\n\nThere's a trick in physics and math called \"vector decomposition,\" which is what /u/briant1234 was talking about. Lots of things in physics are what we call *vectors*, which is a type of \"number\" that has both a direction and a magnitude (strength).\n\nVelocity, for example, is a vector. When you have a velocity, you have both a speed and a direction of travel (in physics, \"speed\" is just speed, whereas \"velocity\" has a direction as well).\n\nSo, let's say your velocity is 14 mph northeast. What we can do is \"decompose\" your velocity into north and east \"components.\" If you travel at 14 mph to the northeast, you're traveling 10 mph directly to the north and 10 mph directly to the east. This is what a decomposition is: it's breaking \"14 mph northeast\" into \"10 mph north and 10 mph east.\"\n\nWe can also apply decomposition to a force, which is what you're applying to the wagon to make it move. Specifically, we'll break it into a horizontal component and a vertical component.\n\nWhether you push or pull, the horizontal component of force is the same (assuming you can push just as hard as you can pull). It's always just forwards.\n\nHowever, if you pull, the *vertical* component of the force is generally upwards. In contrast, when you push, the vertical component is downwards. Since your goal is to clear an obstacle on the ground, you need to apply an upwards force to the wagon.\n\nThat's why pulling it is easier: you're helping the wagon clear the obstacle by pulling up as well as to the side. When you push, you're actually making it harder, because you're pushing it down into the obstruction.",

Whipped Coconut Cream: If you're looking for a dairy-free alternative to whipped cream, you can try using coconut cream instead. Simply chill a can of full-fat coconut milk in the fridge, then scoop out the thick cream that rises to the top and whip it with a mixer or whisk until it forms stiff peaks.

In much the same way as that 2d being was moving through the 3rd dimension, and so experiencing something changing over time from it's perspective, we are moving/falling through the 4th dimension. Instead of falling from up to down, we are falling from past to future and things appear, grow, shrink, and eventually seem to disappear in the same way as that balloon seemed to vanish for the 2D being even though it was still there just outside of it's perception.

    "input": "How can we ethically justify training graduate students? My background is in biomedical research, and I'm currently a research scientist, applying for TT positions. I've been struggling with the idea of training my own graduate students and for years now I've been reluctant to encourage undergraduates to continue on to grad school. Every time an undergraduate research assistant has expressed interest in pursuing a PhD, I've tried to explain to them the enormity of the deck stacked against them. To wit:  * Compared to other highly educated people in the general population, PhD students are about 2.5 times more likely to be at risk for depression and other psychiatric disorders.  About one in three end up with symptoms of a psychiatric disorder.   * For 80% of grad students, an academic career is the goal, but just over 10% actually achieve a faculty position. And those 10% are not equally distributed across institutions, but disproportionately come from elite institutions 1-3], the kinds of which I will most likely not be teaching at.  * [Most biomedical PhDs end up having to do a postdoc, but postdoc salaries are lower than that of a new college graduate even though the postdoc is working 50+ hours per week and is 9 years older than the new college grad.   * 20% of postdocs report having existential crises related to their careers.  * If the postdoc goes into industry, their salary (~$48K/yr )  is still less than the median new college grad (~50K/yr) AND it's unlikely the private sector biology PhD will be able to continue doing research 4-5]. Indeed, if the postdoc sticks with research, they can expect to be paid [less.   * Moreover, several studies agree that there isnt any evidence a postdoc will actually benefit seekers of non-academic jobs 6-8]. When comparing private sector workers 10 years post-PhD, the salary of those who went the postdoc route are [$12,000 lower than those who skipped postdocs altogether.   So if I encourage someone to go to grad school, I'm essentially putting them on a path toward some pretty dire consequences for their career, especially if they do a postdoc, which most will. If they're not getting paid well, they're not getting training that can help them thrive outside of academia, and they're miserable, how can I justify telling them to go this route?   I think I'm a pretty good mentor. I think my research is important. But I'm realistic about the prospects of my trainees. They're not all going to end up in tenured faculty positions, and the numbers concerning the alternatives are all pretty grim. I can try my best to make sure my students aren't stressed out horribly, but I can't do anything to ensure they'll have meaningful, fulfilling jobs in science that actually pay enough to make grad school worthwhile.   So how do you do it? How do we as mentors look our students in the eyes and tell them to ignore the statistics and persevere, hoping they'll be one of the few to buck the trends?

I really don't think that I would have done better in the private sector being someone who was bright, but didn't really know how professional fields work at all.

        "I understand your concerns about the challenges and uncertainties that come with pursuing a graduate degree and a career in academia. It's important to acknowledge that the path to a PhD and beyond can be difficult, and the prospects of securing a tenured faculty position are indeed low. However, I would argue that there are ways to ethically justify training graduate students, even in light of these challenges.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that graduate school provides students with valuable skills and experiences that can benefit them in various careers, not just in academia. Pursuing a graduate degree can help students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and leadership skills, which are highly valued in many industries. Moreover, graduate students can gain experience in teaching, mentoring, and collaborative research, which can be valuable in a wide range of careers.\n\nSecondly, it's important to note that many graduate students and postdocs are motivated by factors other than the prospect of securing a tenured faculty position. Some may be passionate about a particular research area, want to contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge, or seek to develop their skills and expertise to pursue alternative careers in industry, government, or non-profit organizations. By providing mentorship and training, you can help your students achieve their goals and develop fulfilling careers, even if they don't end up in academia.\n\nThirdly, as a mentor, you have the opportunity to create a supportive and nurturing environment for your students. You can help them navigate the challenges of graduate school, provide guidance on their research and career development, and foster a sense of community and collaboration. By doing",

    "output_1": "I'm a Hindu atheist, so I don't actually believe in reincarnation, but this is how my parents explained the reason for this belief to me.\n\nThe ancient Hindu philosophers believed in karma. Karma is basically the ancient concept of justice. If you do good deeds, your life will be good, and if you sin, you will bear the consequences of it. But they observed that this was not always the case. They saw that many people who were righteous abd good had evil befall them, and many evildoers led long and happy lives. This was a basic flaw in their reasoning, that would have proved their belief false.\n\nChristians too had the same problem in their reasoning. They got around it by saying that God rewards their good deeds by keeping them in heaven or punishes their bad deeds by sending them to hell after death. The Hindu philosophers, on the other hand, explained this by saying that people who sinned would be reborn as lesser beings, or lead their next life in misery, while the good people would be rewarded with a happy next life. This was also used to explain why people who were good and righteous lead miserable lives- it was due to their sins in past lives!\n\nSo this meant that the soul was in a never ending cycle of rebirths. The only way to escape from this cycle was moksha. Souls could attain their original divine state and become one with the creator. This could be achieved by three ways- the pursuit of knowledge or enlightenment, doing good deeds and living increasingly rightoeus and honourable lives, and devotion to God.",

Hindus believe that the Jiva or Atman (soul) is intrinsically pure. However, because of the layers of I-ness and My-ness, the jiva goes through transmigration in the cycle of births and deaths. Death destroys the physical body, but not the jiva. The jiva is eternal. It takes on another bodywith respect to its karmas. Every karma produces a result which must be experienced either in this or some future life. As long as the jiva is enveloped in ignorance, it remains attached to material desires and subject to the cycles of births and deaths (Samsara).\n\n_URL_0_\n\nTL; DR if you give up material things and your ignorance, you escape the cycle of reincarnation.

Increased export costs: As the Ruble depreciates, Russian exports become more expensive for foreign buyers, which can lead to a decrease in demand and a negative impact on Russia's trade balance.\n2. Increased inflation: A weaker Ruble can lead to higher inflation in Russia, as imports become more expensive and the cost of living increases.\n3. Reduced purchasing power: The decline of the Ruble can reduce the purchasing power of Russian consumers, making it more difficult for them to afford foreign goods and services.\n4. Negative impact on foreign investment: A declining Ruble can make foreign investors hesitant to invest in Russia, as the currency risk can be seen as too high.\n5. Positive impact on Russian exports: A weaker Ruble can make Russian exports cheaper and more competitive in the global market, which can lead to an increase in exports and a positive impact on Russia's economy.\n\nAs for the United States, a declining Ruble can have both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, American exports to Russia can become more competitive, leading to increased exports and economic growth. On the negative side, a weaker Ruble can lead to increased competition for American businesses, as Russian companies can offer cheaper products and services.\n\nIt is difficult to predict with certainty whether the Ruble will bounce back.

        "This problem is a classic example of a \"watering problem\" and can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to keep track of the maximum height the flower can reach based on the number of days that have passed and the number of times it has been watered.\n\nLet dp[i] be the maximum height the flower can reach after i days, assuming it has been watered i times. Then, we can fill in the dp array as follows:\n\n* dp[0] = 1, since the flower starts at a height of 1 centimeter.\n* For each i from 1 to n, we have:\n\t+ If the flower is watered on day i, then dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] + 5, dp[i-1] + 1). This is because the flower grows by 5 centimeters if it is watered on two consecutive days, or by 1 centimeter if it is only watered on day i.\n\t+ If the flower is not watered on day i, then dp[i] = dp[i-1]. This is because the flower does not grow if it is not watered.\n\nFinally, the height of the flower after n days is given by dp[n]. If the flower dies (i.e., dp[n] < 0), then the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is dp[n].\n\nHere is the pseudocode:\n```\ndp = [1] * (n + 1)\nfor i from 1 to n:\n    if a[i] == 1:\n        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1] + 5, dp[",
