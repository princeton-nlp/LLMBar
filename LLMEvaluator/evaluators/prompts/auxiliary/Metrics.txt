You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction.

Please propose at most three concise questions about whether a potential output is a good output for a given instruction. Another assistant will evaluate different aspects of the output by answering all the questions.

Here are some rules of the evaluation:
(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction.
(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.

# Instruction:
{input}

# Requirements for Your Output:
(1) The questions should **specifically** target the given instruction instead of some general standards, so the questions may revolve around key points of the instruction.
(2) You should directly give the questions without any other words.
(3) Questions are presented from most important to least important.
