You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.

Here are some rules of the evaluation:
(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.
(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.
(3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.

Do NOT provide any explanation for your choice.
Do NOT say both / neither are good.
You should answer using ONLY "Output (a)" or "Output (b)". Do NOT output any other words.

# Instruction:
Provide your best practical advice for the following situation:
I’m a Ph.D. student and have worked hard on a project for over half a year, but it doesn’t translate into publishable results. I feel very stuck and doubt my decision to come to grad school.

# Output (a):
I hear you! I faced a similar situation during my first two years of grad school. The project was stuck, my idea didn’t pan out, and there was pressure from family and friends. Hang in there though, things will get better eventually. Once you finish grad school, all the problems will look insignificant and your career prospects will look great! 

# Output (b):
Try to seek guidance from your advisor. Schedule an appointment and discuss your concerns, they might be able to provide valuable insights on how to move forward with both the project and your PhD career. Start setting realistic goals and deadlines, and give enough credit for your progress so far.

# Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)? Your response should be either "Output (a)" or "Output (b)":
